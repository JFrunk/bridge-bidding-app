## ðŸ§ª Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Trigger Detection
```bash
# Stage a file that creates a new directory
git add backend/api/new_routes.py  # (hypothetical)

# Run trigger detection
python3 .claude/scripts/check_architectural_triggers.py --verbose

# Expected: HIGH-RISK trigger for new directory
# Exit code: 2
```

### Test 2: Compliance Report
```bash
# Generate text report
python3 .claude/scripts/architectural_compliance_report.py --verbose

# Expected: Report showing current state
# Exit code: 0, 1, or 2 depending on issues found

# Generate HTML report
python3 .claude/scripts/architectural_compliance_report.py --html -o report.html

# Expected: report.html created
```

### Test 3: Framework Access
```bash
# Verify framework is readable
cat .claude/ARCHITECTURAL_DECISION_FRAMEWORK.md

# Expected: Full framework displayed
```

### Test 4: ADR Creation
```bash
# Create a new ADR manually
cp .claude/ARCHITECTURAL_DECISION_FRAMEWORK.md temp_template.md
# Extract ADR template section
# Create ADR-0001-test.md

# Expected: ADR follows template format
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Baseline Metrics

Run to establish baseline (for future comparison):

```bash
python3 .claude/scripts/architectural_compliance_report.py --verbose > baseline_report.txt
```

**Track over time:**
- God classes (files > 500 lines)
- Global state instances
- Circular dependencies
- Average dependencies per module
- ADR count
- Test organization score

## ðŸ“ž Support

### If Something Doesn't Work

**Trigger detection script not running:**
```bash
chmod +x .claude/scripts/check_architectural_triggers.py
python3 .claude/scripts/check_architectural_triggers.py --verbose
```

**Compliance report not running:**
```bash
chmod +x .claude/scripts/architectural_compliance_report.py
python3 .claude/scripts/architectural_compliance_report.py --verbose
```

**Framework not visible to Claude:**
- Verify `.claude/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` has architectural section at top
- Verify `.claude/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` has architectural section
- Verify templates are updated
- Claude should auto-load `.claude/` files

**Need to adjust framework:**
- Edit `.claude/ARCHITECTURAL_DECISION_FRAMEWORK.md`
- Update trigger list, decision matrix, or process
- Document changes in framework itself
- Update integration points if needed
