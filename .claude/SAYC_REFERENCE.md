## Competitive Bidding

### Overcalls
- Simple overcall: 8-16 HCP, 5+ card suit

- Jump overcall: Preemptive (like weak two or three-bid)

### Michaels Cuebid
Direct cuebid of opponent's suit shows 5-5 or better:
- Over minor: Both majors
- Over major: Other major + unspecified minor

### Unusual 2NT
Jump to 2NT over opponent's opening shows 5-5 in two lowest unbid suits.

### Negative Double
Through 2♠, shows 4+ cards in unbid major(s), 6+ HCP.

Examples:
- (1♣) - Dbl = 4-4+ in majors
- (1♦) - 1♠ - Dbl = exactly 4 spades
- (1♥) - 1♠ - Dbl = 4 hearts (6+ HCP) or 5 hearts (5-10 HCP)

## After Opponent's Takeout Double

| Bid | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| New suit at 1-level | Forcing, not limited |
| New suit at 2-level | Non-forcing, 6-10 HCP, 6+ cards |
| 2NT | Limit raise or better (10+ points) |
| Redouble | 10+ HCP |
| Jump raise (3M) | Preemptive, good support, <10 HCP |
| Jump shift | Weak, 6+ card suit |

---

## Key Principles

1. **Five-card majors** in all seats (occasionally 4 in 3rd seat)
2. **Forcing bids**: New suit by responder, reverse, jump shift, 2♣ opening
3. **Non-forcing**: Raises, rebids of own suit, 1NT response to major
4. **Fourth suit forcing**: Artificial, asks for more information
5. **Support points**: Add for shortness when raising partner (void=5, singleton=3, doubleton=1)
