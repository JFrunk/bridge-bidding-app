After identifying the root cause of an issue, systematically check if it affects other parts of the codebase:

1. **Pattern Search**: Use grep/glob to find similar code patterns
2. **Impact Analysis**: List ALL affected components/features
3. **Solution Scope**: Determine if fix should be applied broadly
4. **Present Findings**: Show user the full scope before implementing

Reference the systematic analysis checklist in `.claude/CODING_GUIDELINES.md` and present comprehensive findings.
