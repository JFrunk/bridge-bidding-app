## Code Review Checklist

### 1. Code Quality

**Read the code and check:**
- [ ] Functions are focused and do one thing
- [ ] Variable names are clear and descriptive
- [ ] No magic numbers (use constants)
- [ ] Error handling is present
- [ ] No code duplication (DRY principle)
- [ ] Comments explain "why", not "what"
- [ ] No commented-out code left behind

---

### 2. Testing

**Verify tests exist:**
- [ ] Unit tests for new functions/classes
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Regression tests for bug fixes
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Test names are descriptive
- [ ] Tests are independent (no order dependency)

**Run tests:**
```bash
pytest [test_file] -v
```

---

### 3. Documentation

**Check documentation completeness:**
- [ ] Docstrings for all functions/classes
- [ ] Feature documentation in docs/features/
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated (if architecture changed)
- [ ] API endpoints documented
- [ ] README updated (if setup changed)
- [ ] Inline comments for complex logic

---

### 4. Quality Baselines (if applicable)

**If bidding logic changed:**
- [ ] Bidding quality baseline run (500 hands)
- [ ] No regression in composite score (¬±2% tolerance)
- [ ] Legality remains 100%

**If play logic changed:**
- [ ] Play quality baseline run (500 hands, level 8)
- [ ] No regression in composite score (¬±2% tolerance)
- [ ] Legality remains 100%

### 5. UI/UX Standards (if frontend changed)

**Design System Compliance:**
- [ ] Uses CSS variables (no hardcoded colors)
- [ ] Uses spacing system (--space-2, --space-4, etc.)
- [ ] Responsive at breakpoints (375px, 768px, 1280px)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] ARIA labels present
- [ ] Touch targets ‚â•44px on mobile
