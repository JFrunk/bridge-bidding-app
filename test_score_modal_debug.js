/*
 * Debug script to identify score modal inconsistency
 * 
 * Theory: The score modal appears inconsistently because:
 * 1. Sometimes the check for totalTricks === 13 happens too early
 * 2. The AI loop might be restarting after trick 13
 * 3. There's a race condition between user and AI plays

SCORING FLOW ANALYSIS
=====================

User plays last card (trick 13):
1. handleCardPlay() called
2. Card is played via /api/play-card
3. Backend updates tricks_won[winner] += 1
4. Backend returns trick_complete=true, trick_winner='X'
5. Frontend waits 2.5 seconds
6. Frontend calls /api/clear-trick
7. Frontend fetches updated state via /api/get-play-state
8. Frontend checks: totalTricks === 13?
   - IF YES: Call /api/complete-play and setScoreData(scoreData)
   - IF NO: Continue AI loop

AI plays last card (trick 13):
1. AI loop fetches /api/get-play-state
2. Checks totalTricks === 13
   - IF YES: Call /api/complete-play and setScoreData(scoreData)
   - IF NO: Continue
3. AI calls /api/get-ai-play
4. Backend plays card via /api/play-card
5. Same flow as user play above

POTENTIAL ISSUES:
=================

Issue 1: Check happens BEFORE trick 13 is counted
- The check "totalTricks === 13" happens AFTER clearing trick
- But tricks_won is updated BEFORE clearing (line 1536 in server.py)
- So this should work correctly

Issue 2: Score modal is shown but immediately hidden
- If resetAuction() or handleCloseScore() is called right after setScoreData()
- Check: Are there any automatic close actions?

Issue 3: The last card is played by user when they shouldn't
- If user plays when it's actually AI's turn
- The AI loop might continue and interfere

Issue 4: Multiple setScoreData calls overwrite each other
- Not likely since scoreData comes from API

RECOMMENDATION:
===============
Add console.log statements to track:
1. When totalTricks check happens and what the value is
2. When setScoreData is called with actual data
3. When setScoreData(null) is called
4. When ScoreModal render happens
