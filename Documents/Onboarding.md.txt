# Developer Onboarding Guide


## 1. Prerequisites
* Python 3.9+
* Node.js 16+ and npm
* Git for version control
* An Anaconda distribution of Python is used by the current developer, which can cause environment conflicts (see TROUBLESHOOTING.md).


## 2. Backend Setup
1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2.  Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3.  Activate the environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
4.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Assuming a requirements file exists).


## 3. Frontend Setup
1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`


## 4. Running the Application
The backend and frontend must be run in separate terminals.


* **Start the Backend Server:**
    * **IMPORTANT:** If you have Anaconda installed, you may have a conflicted environment. First, run `conda deactivate` until `(base)` is gone from your prompt.
    * From the project's root directory, run the full command:
    ```bash
    cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && python -m flask --app server --debug run --port 5001
    ```


* **Start the Frontend Server:**
    * From the project's root directory, run:
    ```bash
    cd frontend && npm start
    ```
    The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
