## 🧪 Tested Endpoints

### ✅ Working Endpoints

**1. User Info** - `GET /api/user/info?user_id=1`
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "player1",
    "display_name": "Player One",
    "email": "player1@example.com"
  },
  "stats": {
    "total_xp": 0,
    "current_level": 1,
    "xp_to_next_level": 500,
    "current_streak": 0,
    "total_hands": 0,
    "overall_accuracy": 0.0
  },
  "settings": {
    "tracking_enabled": 1,
    "celebrate_achievements": 1,
    "difficulty_preference": "adaptive"
  }
}
```
**Status:** ✅ Working perfectly

### ⚠️ Endpoints Needing Practice Data

These endpoints work but need practice data to return meaningful results:
- `GET /api/analytics/dashboard` - Needs patterns
- `GET /api/analytics/mistakes` - Needs practice history
- `GET /api/analytics/celebrations` - Needs achievements
- `POST /api/practice/record` - Ready to use

## 📝 Next Steps for Full Integration

### Phase 1: Backend Testing (Optional)
Record some practice hands to test the full flow:

```bash
# Using Python
PYTHONPATH=. python3 << 'EOF'
from engine.learning.analytics_api import *
# Add test practice data
# Test pattern analysis
# Verify celebrations trigger
EOF
```

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration (Required)
1. **Import Components** in your React app:
   ```jsx
   import LearningDashboard from './components/learning/LearningDashboard';
   import { CelebrationToastContainer } from './components/learning/CelebrationNotification';
   ```

2. **Add Dashboard** to navigation:
   ```jsx
   <Route path="/learning" element={<LearningDashboard userId={1} />} />
   ```

3. **Add Celebration Notifications** to practice mode:
   ```jsx
   <CelebrationToastContainer celebrations={celebrations} onClose={handleClose} />
   ```

4. **Update Practice Recording** to use new endpoint:
   ```jsx
   import { recordPractice } from './services/analyticsService';

   const result = await recordPractice({
     user_id: userId,
     user_bid: userBid,
     correct_bid: correctBid,
     was_correct: wasCorrect
   });
   ```

### Phase 3: Testing & Refinement
- Test complete practice flow
- Verify celebrations appear
- Check dashboard displays correctly
- Adjust celebration thresholds if needed
- Add more error categories as patterns emerge
