## ✅ Completed Improvements

### October 16, 2025

**File**: [`IMPROVEMENTS_2025-10-16.md`](IMPROVEMENTS_2025-10-16.md)

1. **Auto-Bidding Bug Fix** ✅ CRITICAL
   - **Issue**: System auto-bid for all players after "Deal New Hand"
   - **Fix**: Added `skipInitialAiBidding = true` to reset functions
   - **Impact**: Users can now bid their own hands
   - **Files**: `frontend/src/App.js`

2. **Weak 1NT Overcall Logic** ✅ MODERATE
   - **Issue**: AI too conservative with marginal stoppers
   - **Fix**: Accept Jxx/Qx stoppers with 15+ HCP
   - **Impact**: Better competitive bidding
   - **Files**: `backend/engine/overcalls.py`

   - Test phase transitions
   - Impact: Prevent regressions
   - Effort: 1-2 days

#### AI Improvements

4. **Enhance Competitive Bidding AI**
