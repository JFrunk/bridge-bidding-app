### BUG-010: Login Screen "Failed to Fetch" Error

**Severity:** üî¥ Critical
**Impact:** Users cannot create accounts or login
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Active Issue
**Discovered:** 2025-10-18
**User Report:** "Failed to fetch" error when attempting to login with email

#### Problem Description

When users attempt to login via the email/phone authentication screen, they receive a "Failed to fetch" error message immediately after entering credentials and clicking "Continue".

**User Experience:**
```
Welcome to Bridge Bidding Practice
üìß Email / üì± Phone
Enter your email to continue

Email Address: junkfrunk@gmail.com
Display Name: [optional field]

[Click "Continue"]

‚ùå Error shown: "Failed to fetch"
```

#### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issue: Backend Server Connection**

The frontend is configured to connect to the auth API at:
- `http://localhost:5001/api/auth/login` (from AuthContext.jsx line 5)

**Possible causes:**

1. **Backend server not running**
   - Flask server.py not started
   - Server crashed or stopped

2. **Port mismatch**
   - Frontend expects port 5001
   - Backend running on different port (5000?)
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable incorrect

3. **CORS configuration**
   - Backend not configured to accept requests from frontend origin
   - Preflight OPTIONS request failing

4. **Network/firewall issue**
   - Localhost blocked
   - Firewall preventing connection

#### Files Involved

**Frontend:**
- `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` (line 5) - API URL configuration
- `frontend/src/components/auth/SimpleLogin.jsx` (lines 14-50) - Login form handler

**Backend:**
- `backend/server.py` (lines 120-122) - Auth endpoints registration
- `backend/engine/auth/simple_auth_api.py` - Auth implementation

#### Test Plan

**Test Case TC-010-01: Verify Backend Server Running**
```bash
# 1. Check if server is running
ps aux | grep "python.*server.py"

# 2. Check which port backend is using
lsof -i -P | grep python | grep LISTEN

# Expected: server.py listening on port 5000 or 5001

# 3. Test API endpoint directly
curl http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com"}'

# Expected: JSON response (not connection refused)
```

**Test Case TC-010-02: Frontend API URL Configuration**
```bash
# 1. Check frontend environment variable
cd frontend
cat .env | grep API_URL

# 2. Check if REACT_APP_API_URL is set
echo $REACT_APP_API_URL

# 3. Verify AuthContext uses correct URL
grep "API_URL" src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx

# Expected: API_URL matches running server port
```

**Test Case TC-010-03: CORS Configuration**
```bash
# 1. Test CORS headers from backend
curl -X OPTIONS http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
  -v

# Expected: Access-Control-Allow-Origin header present
```

**Test Case TC-010-04: End-to-End Login Flow**
```
Setup:
  1. Start backend server (python3 backend/server.py)
  2. Start frontend server (cd frontend && npm start)
  3. Open browser to http://localhost:3000

Steps:
  1. Click login button to open login modal
  2. Enter valid email: test@example.com
  3. Click "Continue"
  4. Monitor browser console and network tab

Expected Result:
  ‚úÖ POST request to /api/auth/login shows status 200
  ‚úÖ Response contains session_token
  ‚úÖ User is logged in (modal closes)
  ‚úÖ No "Failed to fetch" error

Actual Result (Bug):
  ‚ùå Network tab shows "Failed to fetch" or connection refused
  ‚ùå No request reaches backend
  ‚ùå Error message displayed to user
```

#### Debugging Steps

**Step 1: Verify Backend is Running**
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate  # If using venv
python3 server.py

# Look for:
# ‚úì Simple Auth API endpoints registered (MVP - email only)
# * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

**Step 2: Check Backend Port**
```python
# In backend/server.py, look for:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)  # or port=5001?
```

**Step 3: Test Backend Directly**
```bash
# With server running, test endpoint:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","display_name":"Test User"}'

# Expected success response:
{
  "success": true,
  "session_token": "...",
  "user": {...},
  "is_new_user": true
}
```

**Step 4: Verify Frontend Configuration**
```javascript
// Check frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx line 5:
const API_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5001';

// If backend is on port 5000, create frontend/.env:
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

**Step 5: Check Browser Console**
```
Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Console tab
Look for errors like:
- "Failed to fetch"
- "net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"
- "CORS policy blocked"

Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
Try login again
Check if request even fires
```

#### Proposed Fixes

**Fix 1: Port Mismatch (Most Likely)**

If backend runs on port 5000 but frontend expects 5001:

```bash
# Option A: Change frontend to match backend
cd frontend
echo "REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000" > .env
npm start  # Restart required for .env changes

# Option B: Change backend to match frontend
# Edit backend/server.py:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5001)  # Change 5000 to 5001
```

**Fix 2: CORS Not Configured**

If backend doesn't allow frontend origin:

```python
# In backend/server.py, add Flask-CORS:
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)  # Allow all origins (development)

# Or restrict to frontend only:
CORS(app, origins=["http://localhost:3000"])
```

**Fix 3: Backend Not Running**

Add clear startup instructions:

```bash
# In README.md, add:
## Running the Application

1. Start Backend:
   cd backend
   source venv/bin/activate  # If using venv
   python3 server.py
   # Wait for "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000"

2. Start Frontend (new terminal):
   cd frontend
   npm start
   # Opens http://localhost:3000 automatically

3. Login should now work
```

**Fix 4: Better Error Handling**

Improve error message in frontend:

```javascript
// In SimpleLogin.jsx, catch network errors:
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  try {
    const result = await login(credentials);
    // ... success handling
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.message === 'Failed to fetch') {
      setError('Cannot connect to server. Please ensure the backend is running on http://localhost:5000');
    } else {
      setError(error.message);
    }
  }
}
```

#### Resolution Criteria

- [ ] Backend server runs successfully on documented port
- [ ] Frontend .env or AuthContext points to correct backend URL
- [ ] CORS configured correctly (if needed)
- [ ] Test Case TC-010-04 passes (end-to-end login works)
- [ ] No "Failed to fetch" errors in browser console
- [ ] Users can successfully create accounts and login
- [ ] README.md has clear startup instructions

#### Automated Test Script

**File:** Create `test_login_connection.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Testing Backend Connection for Login..."

# 1. Check if backend is running
if ! lsof -i :5000 > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "‚ùå FAIL: Backend not running on port 5000"
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ Backend is running on port 5000"

# 2. Test login endpoint
response=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com"}')

if echo "$response" | grep -q "session_token"; then
    echo "‚úÖ Login endpoint working"
else
    echo "‚ùå FAIL: Login endpoint not responding correctly"
    echo "Response: $response"
    exit 1
fi

# 3. Check frontend environment
if [ -f "frontend/.env" ]; then
    frontend_url=$(grep REACT_APP_API_URL frontend/.env | cut -d '=' -f2)
    if [ "$frontend_url" == "http://localhost:5000" ]; then
        echo "‚úÖ Frontend .env correctly configured"
    else
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Frontend .env points to $frontend_url (should be http://localhost:5000)"
    fi
else
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: frontend/.env not found (will use default port 5001)"
fi

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ ALL TESTS PASSED - Login should work"
```

**Usage:**
```bash
chmod +x test_login_connection.sh
./test_login_connection.sh
```

#### Priority Justification

**Why Critical:**
1. **Blocks all authenticated users** - Cannot save progress, cannot identify users
2. **First impression issue** - Login is often first user interaction
3. **Complete feature failure** - Auth system entirely non-functional if server not connected
4. **Affects all users** - 100% of users trying to login will hit this

**Why it might not be discovered in development:**
- Developer may have server running persistently
- Developer may be using "Continue as Guest" instead
- Works fine once server is running, so intermittent nature

**Production Impact:**
If deployed without fixing:
- Users cannot create accounts
- Users cannot login
- Progress not saved
- Appears as completely broken app

**Estimated Effort:** 30 minutes - 2 hours
- 30 min if just port mismatch
- 1 hour if need to add CORS
- 2 hours if need to refactor environment configuration

## üü° HIGH PRIORITY BUGS (Should Fix Before Launch)

### BUG-001: Expert AI Makes Terrible Discards

**Severity:** üü° High
**Impact:** User trust in AI quality
**Status:** üîÑ Partially Fixed (validation added, AI logic under investigation)
**Discovered:** 2025-10-18
**Documentation:** `BUG_REPORT_IMPOSSIBLE_CARD_PLAY_2025-10-18.md`, `DISCARD_BUG_FIX_COMPLETE.md`

#### Problem Description

Expert AI (8/10, 9/10 difficulty) occasionally discards high-value cards (Kings, Queens) when low cards from weak suits are available.

**Example Scenario:**
- East (Expert AI 9/10) is void in spades
- East holds: ‚ô•QT8 ‚ô¶T76 ‚ô£KJT963
- North leads ‚ô†7 (opponent's winning trick)
- **Expected:** Discard ‚ô¶6 or ‚ô¶7 (lowest from weakest suit)
- **Actual:** Discarded ‚ô£K (potential winner from long suit)

#### Root Cause

Two issues discovered:

1. **Minimax AI Evaluation:** When DDS solver unavailable, Minimax AI's evaluation function occasionally prioritizes keeping suit length over card strength
2. **Move Ordering:** High cards were examined first even in discard situations

#### Fixes Applied

**‚úÖ Completed:**
1. Added AI card validation before playing ([server.py:1583-1615](backend/server.py#L1583-L1615))
2. Improved discard logic in Minimax AI ([minimax_ai.py:364-430](backend/engine/play/ai/minimax_ai.py#L364-L430))
3. Added tolerance-based tiebreaker to prefer low cards ([minimax_ai.py:167-208](backend/engine/play/ai/minimax_ai.py#L167-208))
4. Improved DDS fallback heuristics ([dds_ai.py:380-412](backend/engine/play/ai/dds_ai.py#L380-412))

**üîÑ In Progress:**
- Comprehensive testing across all Expert AI scenarios
- Verification that DDS solver is working correctly on all systems

#### Test Plan

**Test Case TC-001-01: Basic Discard Scenario**
```
Setup:
  Contract: 4‚ô† by South
  Position: East (Expert AI 9/10)
  Trick: North leads ‚ô†7 (East void in spades)
  East's Hand: ‚ô†- ‚ô•QT8 ‚ô¶T76 ‚ô£KJT9632

Steps:
  1. Start hand with above setup
  2. Reach trick where East must discard
  3. Observe East's discard choice

Expected Result:
  ‚úÖ East discards ‚ô¶6, ‚ô¶7, or ‚ô£2/3 (low cards)
  ‚ùå East does NOT discard ‚ô£K, ‚ô£J, ‚ô•Q, ‚ô•T

Pass Criteria:
  - Must pass 10/10 trials
  - Average discard rank ‚â§ 6 (avoid T, J, Q, K, A)
```

**Test Case TC-001-02: Multiple Discard Opportunities**
```
Setup:
  Contract: Any NT contract
  Position: Any AI position at Expert level
  Generate 100 random hands

Steps:
  1. Play 100 hands at Expert AI (9/10)
  2. Track all discard situations (void in led suit)
  3. Record: Which cards were discarded vs available

Expected Result:
  ‚úÖ >90% of discards are low cards (2-7)
  ‚úÖ <5% of discards are honors (J-K)
  ‚úÖ <1% of discards are Aces

Pass Criteria:
  - Must meet all three thresholds
  - No Kings discarded when low cards available
```

**Test Case TC-001-03: DDS Solver Availability**
```
Setup:
  System with DDS properly installed
  System without DDS (fallback to Minimax)

Steps:
  1. Verify DDS status at startup
  2. Run same discard scenario with/without DDS
  3. Compare discard quality

Expected Result:
  ‚úÖ DDS should make optimal discards (if available)
  ‚úÖ Minimax fallback should make acceptable discards
  ‚úÖ No "terrible" discards in either mode

Pass Criteria:
  - DDS: 100% correct discards
  - Minimax: ‚â•95% acceptable discards
```

#### Automated Test

**File:** `backend/test_discard_fix.py`

```bash
# Run test
cd backend
python3 test_discard_fix.py

# Expected Output
‚úÖ ALL TESTS PASSED - AI correctly discards low cards
```

#### Resolution Criteria

- [ ] All 3 test cases pass consistently
- [ ] User testing confirms improved AI discards
- [ ] No further complaints about "AI throwing away Kings"
- [ ] DDS solver working on target production environment

**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours (testing and verification)

### BUG-002: First Hand After Server Startup - Illegal Bidding Sequence

**Severity:** üü° High
**Impact:** First user impression is broken game
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Not Reproduced / Intermittent
**Discovered:** 2025-10-10
**Documentation:** `RESIDUAL_ISSUES.md` lines 7-104

#### Problem Description

On the **first hand dealt after server startup**, all three AI players sometimes bid identically (e.g., all bid 1NT), which violates bridge bidding rules.

**Example:**
```
Auction: [1NT, 1NT, 1NT, Pass]
- North: 1NT (17 HCP, balanced 2-4-3-4) ‚úÖ Correct
- East: 1NT (9 HCP, balanced)          ‚ùå ILLEGAL - should Pass
- South: 1NT (8 HCP)                   ‚ùå ILLEGAL - can't bid same level
- West: Pass (6 HCP)                   ‚úÖ Correct
```

**Evidence:** All three AI players received **North's hand data** instead of their own hands during bidding.

#### Root Cause Analysis

**Suspected Issues:**
1. **Race Condition:** Multiple concurrent `/api/get-next-bid` requests firing before state updates complete
2. **Global State Bug:** `current_deal` dictionary access issue
3. **Frontend State Capture:** Stale player position values when AI loop runs
4. **Session Management:** First request after server start has uninitialized session

**Why It's Hard to Reproduce:**
- Timing-dependent (race condition)
- Only happens on first hand after server restart
- May be related to React StrictMode double-rendering in development

#### Test Plan

**Test Case TC-002-01: Server Restart Scenario**
```
Setup:
  1. Stop Flask backend server
  2. Clear browser cache and localStorage
  3. Start Flask backend server
  4. Load frontend in browser

Steps:
  1. Click "Deal New Hand"
  2. Observe first 4 bids in auction
  3. Verify each player bids according to THEIR hand, not North's

Expected Result:
  ‚úÖ Each player receives correct hand data
  ‚úÖ No duplicate bids at same level (unless bidding up in suit rank)
  ‚úÖ Bids are legal given hand HCP and shape

Pass Criteria:
  - Must pass 10/10 server restarts
  - No illegal bidding sequences
  - Hand data logging shows correct player‚Üíhand mapping
```

**Test Case TC-002-02: Concurrent Request Simulation**
```
Setup:
  Python script to fire 4 rapid /api/get-next-bid requests

Steps:
  1. Deal a hand
  2. Simulate 4 AI players requesting bids concurrently
  3. Verify each receives different hand data

Expected Result:
  ‚úÖ North receives North's hand
  ‚úÖ East receives East's hand
  ‚úÖ South receives South's hand
  ‚úÖ West receives West's hand

Pass Criteria:
  - 100/100 concurrent request batches correct
  - No hand data mixing
```

**Test Case TC-002-03: Add Defensive Logging**
```
Location: backend/server.py in /api/get-next-bid endpoint

Add logging:
  print(f"GET-NEXT-BID: player={current_player}")
  print(f"  Hand HCP={player_hand.hcp}")
  print(f"  Hand cards={player_hand.cards[:3]}...")  # First 3 cards

Run Test:
  1. Restart server
  2. Deal first hand
  3. Watch server logs as AI bids
  4. Verify each player logs DIFFERENT HCP values

Expected Output:
  GET-NEXT-BID: player=North
    Hand HCP=15
    Hand cards=[A‚ô†, K‚ô•, Q‚ô¶]...
  GET-NEXT-BID: player=East
    Hand HCP=8
    Hand cards=[2‚ô†, 7‚ô•, 9‚ô¶]...
  GET-NEXT-BID: player=South
    Hand HCP=10
    Hand cards=[K‚ô†, J‚ô•, 8‚ô¶]...

Pass Criteria:
  - All 4 players show DIFFERENT HCP values
  - HCP sum across 4 players = 40
```

#### Proposed Fixes

**Short-term (Defensive Programming):**

1. **Add validation in `/api/get-next-bid`:**
```python
# Validate player position
if current_player not in ['North', 'East', 'South', 'West']:
    return jsonify({'error': f'Invalid player: {current_player}'}), 400

# Validate hand exists
if not player_hand:
    return jsonify({'error': f'No hand for {current_player}'}), 500

# Validate hand is unique (not a duplicate of another player's)
if current_player != 'North' and player_hand.hcp == current_deal['North'].hcp:
    logger.error(f"BUG: {current_player} received North's hand!")
    # Try to recover: re-fetch hand from session
    # If still fails, return error
```

2. **Add request queuing:**
```python
# Use a lock to prevent concurrent bid requests
from threading import Lock
bid_lock = Lock()

@app.route('/api/get-next-bid', methods=['POST'])
def get_next_bid():
    with bid_lock:
        # Process bid request here
        # Ensures only one bid processed at a time
```

3. **Frontend debouncing:**
```javascript
// Add delay between AI bids
const AI_BID_DELAY = 500; // ms

async function runAiTurn() {
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, AI_BID_DELAY));
    // Then make API call
}
```

**Long-term (Architectural):**

1. Refactor from global `current_deal` to session-based storage
2. Add unique request IDs for tracking
3. Implement proper request queuing with Redis/database

#### Automated Test Script

**File:** Create `backend/test_first_hand_bug.py`

```python
import requests
import subprocess
import time

def test_first_hand_after_restart():
    """Test that first hand after server restart has correct bidding"""

    # 1. Restart server
    print("Restarting server...")
    subprocess.run(["pkill", "-f", "python.*server.py"])
    time.sleep(2)
    server = subprocess.Popen(["python3", "server.py"])
    time.sleep(5)

    # 2. Deal new hand
    response = requests.post("http://localhost:5000/api/deal-new-hand")
    assert response.status_code == 200

    # 3. Get all 4 hands
    hands = response.json()
    hcp_values = {
        'North': hands['North']['hcp'],
        'East': hands['East']['hcp'],
        'South': hands['South']['hcp'],
        'West': hands['West']['hcp']
    }

    # 4. Request bids for each AI player
    bids = {}
    for player in ['North', 'East', 'South', 'West']:
        if player != 'South':  # Skip user
            resp = requests.post(
                "http://localhost:5000/api/get-next-bid",
                json={'current_player': player, 'auction': []}
            )
            assert resp.status_code == 200
            bids[player] = resp.json()

    # 5. Verify each bid is based on correct hand
    for player, bid_data in bids.items():
        explanation = bid_data.get('explanation', '')
        # Extract HCP from explanation
        if f"HCP: {hcp_values[player]}" not in explanation:
            print(f"‚ùå FAIL: {player} bid using wrong hand!")
            print(f"  Expected HCP: {hcp_values[player]}")
            print(f"  Explanation: {explanation}")
            return False

    print("‚úÖ PASS: All players bid with correct hands")
    server.terminate()
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_first_hand_after_restart()
```

#### Resolution Criteria

- [ ] Test Case TC-002-01 passes 10/10 times
- [ ] Test Case TC-002-02 passes 100/100 concurrent batches
- [ ] Logging shows each player receives unique hand data
- [ ] No user reports of "all players bid the same" after fix deployed
- [ ] Automated test script runs in CI/CD pipeline

**Estimated Effort:** 4-8 hours (investigation, fix, testing)

### BUG-003: Hand Display Confusion - Data Presentation Issue

**Severity:** üü° High (User Experience)
**Impact:** Confusing review data, appears like bug even when correct
**Status:** ‚úÖ Identified, Documentation Improvement Needed
**Discovered:** 2025-10-18
**Documentation:** `BUG_REPORT_IMPOSSIBLE_CARD_PLAY_2025-10-18.md` lines 88-95

#### Problem Description

The review request data is confusing because it shows hand state in two different ways:
1. **Hand.cards** - Current cards in hand (updated as cards are played)
2. **Hand.suit_hcp** - HCP from original 13-card deal (immutable, never updated)

This makes it **appear** like a player played a card they didn't have, when actually they HAD it originally and played it.

**Example:**
```
Trick 2: East discarded ‚ô£K

Review Data (requested after trick):
  East's cards: ‚ô†A5 ‚ô•QT8 ‚ô¶T76 ‚ô£JT963  ‚Üê No King! (already played)
  East's suit_hcp: ‚ô£: 4                ‚Üê 4 HCP suggests K+J (original hand)

User sees: "East played ‚ô£K but doesn't have it!"
Reality: East HAD ‚ô£K originally, played it, now removed from cards list
```

#### Root Cause

**Design Decision:** The `Hand` class stores HCP immutably to preserve original hand information for analysis, but shows current cards dynamically.

**Impact:** This is confusing when reviewing hands mid-play or after-play.

#### Test Plan

**Test Case TC-003-01: Review Data Clarity**
```
Setup:
  1. Complete a hand where several cards are played
  2. Request hand review/analysis

Steps:
  1. Compare Hand.cards (current) vs Hand.suit_hcp (original)
  2. Verify documentation clearly explains the difference

Expected Result:
  ‚úÖ Review data includes note: "HCP reflects original 13-card deal"
  ‚úÖ Review data shows which cards have been played (not just current cards)
  ‚úÖ No confusion about "missing" cards

Pass Criteria:
  - User understands why card counts don't match HCP
  - No false bug reports about "impossible" plays
```

#### Proposed Fixes

**Option 1: Improve Documentation (Quick Fix)**
```python
# In Hand class or review request response
def to_review_dict(self):
    return {
        'cards': [str(c) for c in self.cards],
        'suit_hcp': self.suit_hcp,
        '_note': 'HCP values reflect original 13-card deal, not current hand state',
        '_cards_played': len(self.original_cards) - len(self.cards)
    }
```

**Option 2: Track Played Cards (Better UX)**
```python
class Hand:
    def __init__(self, cards):
        self.cards = cards
        self.original_cards = cards.copy()  # Keep original
        self.played_cards = []              # Track what's been played

    def play_card(self, card):
        self.cards.remove(card)
        self.played_cards.append(card)

    def to_review_dict(self):
        return {
            'current_cards': [str(c) for c in self.cards],
            'original_cards': [str(c) for c in self.original_cards],
            'played_cards': [str(c) for c in self.played_cards],
            'hcp_original': self.hcp
        }
```

**Option 3: Show Original vs Current (Best UX)**
```javascript
// Frontend review display
<div className="hand-review">
  <h3>East's Hand</h3>
  <div className="original-hand">
    <label>Original (13 cards):</label>
    <Cards cards={eastOriginal} /> {/* All 13 */}
    <span>HCP: 11</span>
  </div>
  <div className="current-hand">
    <label>Current (after Trick 2):</label>
    <Cards cards={eastCurrent} /> {/* 11 cards */}
  </div>
  <div className="played-cards">
    <label>Played:</label>
    <Cards cards={eastPlayed} crossed={true} /> {/* 2 cards, crossed out */}
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Resolution Criteria

- [ ] Review data clearly shows original vs current hand state
- [ ] No user confusion about "missing" cards
- [ ] Documentation explains HCP is immutable
- [ ] Consider implementing played cards tracking (enhancement)

**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours (documentation) or 4-6 hours (full tracking)

## üü¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY BUGS (Can Fix Post-Launch)

### BUG-004: 5 Play Tests Failing - Hand Parser Issue

**Severity:** üü¢ Medium
**Impact:** Test failures only, no production impact
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Identified but not fixed
**Discovered:** 2025-10-12
**Documentation:** `PROJECT_STATUS.md` lines 204-208

#### Problem Description

5 play engine tests fail due to hand parser creating 14-card hands instead of 13-card hands.

**Failing Tests:**
- `tests/play/test_evaluation.py` - Some evaluation tests
- `tests/play/test_minimax_ai.py` - Some minimax tests

**Note:** This does NOT affect production gameplay, only test helpers.

#### Root Cause

**File:** `tests/play_test_helpers.py`

The hand parsing function sometimes creates hands with 14 cards when parsing string representations.

#### Test Plan

**Test Case TC-004-01: Fix Hand Parser**
```
Setup:
  Review tests/play_test_helpers.py parse_hand() function

Steps:
  1. Identify where extra card is being added
  2. Fix parsing logic
  3. Run all play tests

Expected Result:
  ‚úÖ All hands have exactly 13 cards
  ‚úÖ 45/45 play tests pass (up from 40/45)

Pass Criteria:
  - 100% play test pass rate
```

#### Automated Test

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m pytest tests/play/ -v

# Expected: 45/45 passing
```

#### Resolution Criteria

- [ ] Identify root cause in hand parser
- [ ] Fix parser to create 13-card hands
- [ ] All play tests pass
- [ ] Add assertion: `assert len(hand.cards) == 13`

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours

### BUG-005: AI Auto-Bidding for User Position (Race Condition)

**Severity:** üü¢ Medium
**Impact:** User loses control of bidding (rarely)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
**Discovered:** 2025-10-17
**Documentation:** `USER_CONTROL_FIXES_2025-10-17.md` lines 9-40

#### Problem Description

The AI was occasionally making bids for South (the user's position) during the auction due to a race condition.

**Example:**
```
Expected: North, East, [User's turn - bidding box appears]
Actual:   North, East, Pass ‚Üê AI bid Pass for user!
```

#### Root Cause

Race condition in AI bidding loop - the check for "is it South's turn?" executed AFTER `runAiTurn()` was already called.

#### Fix Applied ‚úÖ

**File:** `frontend/src/App.js` lines 1002-1022

Two-layer defense:
1. Early exit check before AI bidding logic
2. Defense-in-depth inside async function

```javascript
// CRITICAL FIX: Stop AI immediately when it's South's turn
const currentPlayer = players[nextPlayerIndex];
if (currentPlayer === 'South' && isAiBidding) {
  setIsAiBidding(false);
  return; // Exit early
}
```

#### Test Plan (Verification)

**Test Case TC-005-01: User Bidding Control**
```
Steps:
  1. Start new hand with North as dealer
  2. Observe North bids (AI)
  3. Observe East bids (AI)
  4. **Verify South sees bidding box (no auto-bid)**

Expected Result:
  ‚úÖ Bidding box appears for South
  ‚úÖ No automatic Pass is made
  ‚úÖ User has full control

Pass Criteria:
  - 20/20 hands allow user to bid
  - No AI auto-bidding for South
```

**Test Case TC-005-02: All Dealer Positions**
```
Test with dealer in each position:
  - North dealer ‚Üí South is 3rd to bid
  - East dealer ‚Üí South is 2nd to bid
  - South dealer ‚Üí South is 1st to bid
  - West dealer ‚Üí South is 4th to bid

Expected Result:
  ‚úÖ User can bid in all 4 scenarios
  ‚úÖ No race condition in any dealer position

Pass Criteria:
  - 5/5 tests pass for each dealer position
```

#### Resolution Criteria

- [x] Fix applied and deployed
- [ ] Verification testing complete
- [ ] No user reports of AI bidding for them

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed, needs verification testing

**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour (verification only)

### BUG-006: Automatic Play Phase Transition (Removed User Control)

**Severity:** üü¢ Medium
**Impact:** User didn't have time to review contract
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
**Discovered:** 2025-10-17
**Documentation:** `USER_CONTROL_FIXES_2025-10-17.md` lines 42-79

#### Problem Description

After bidding completed, the system automatically transitioned to playing phase after 3 seconds, preventing users from:
- Reviewing the final contract
- Strategizing before play
- Deciding whether to play at all

#### Root Cause

Automatic transition code at `App.js:1044`:
```javascript
// OLD CODE (removed):
setTimeout(() => startPlayPhase(), 3000);
```

#### Fix Applied ‚úÖ

**File:** `frontend/src/App.js` lines 1041-1046

Removed automatic transition - user must click "Play This Hand" button.

#### Test Plan (Verification)

**Test Case TC-006-01: Manual Play Transition**
```
Steps:
  1. Complete bidding sequence (any contract)
  2. Verify 3 passes end auction
  3. **Verify "Play This Hand" button appears**
  4. **Verify play does NOT start automatically**
  5. Click button
  6. Verify play phase starts

Expected Result:
  ‚úÖ Button appears immediately after bidding ends
  ‚úÖ No automatic 3-second countdown
  ‚úÖ User controls when play begins

Pass Criteria:
  - 10/10 hands wait for user click
  - Button is visible and clickable
  - Transition is smooth after click
```

#### Resolution Criteria

- [x] Fix applied and deployed
- [ ] Verification testing complete
- [ ] User feedback confirms better UX

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed, needs verification testing

**Estimated Effort:** 30 minutes (verification only)

## ‚ö™ LOW PRIORITY (Enhancements)

### ENHANCEMENT-001: Missing Advanced Conventions

**Severity:** ‚ö™ Low
**Impact:** Advanced players missing optional features
**Status:** ‚è≥ Not Started (Phase 3)
**Discovered:** Initial development
**Documentation:** `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `CONVENTION_FIXES_PUNCHLIST.md`

#### Description

Four advanced convention modules exist as placeholder files with no implementation:

1. **Michaels Cuebid** - Shows 5-5+ in two suits
2. **Unusual 2NT** - Shows 5-5+ in both minors
3. **Splinter Bids** - Shows singleton/void with support
4. **Fourth Suit Forcing** - Artificial game force

#### Impact

- These are advanced SAYC conventions
- Not essential for basic play
- Most casual players won't miss them
- Tournament players may request them

#### Priority Rationale

**LOW** because:
- Core SAYC works without them
- Simpler conventions (Stayman, Jacoby, Blackwood) cover most needs
- Can be added incrementally based on user demand
- Focus should be on stable core before advanced features

#### Implementation Plan

**Post-Launch Priority:**
- Monitor user feedback
- If 10+ users request, prioritize in Phase 3
- Otherwise, implement as time allows

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks for all 4 conventions

---

### ENHANCEMENT-002: Card Play Phase Missing Features

**Severity:** ‚ö™ Low
**Impact:** Nice-to-have UX improvements
**Status:** ‚è≥ Documented
**Discovered:** 2025-10-10
**Documentation:** `RESIDUAL_ISSUES.md` lines 172-209

#### Description

Card play phase is functional but missing quality-of-life features:

1. **Play History UI** - Visual display of completed tricks
2. **Undo/Redo** - Cannot undo last card play
3. **Claim Feature** - Cannot claim remaining tricks
4. **Play Analysis** - No feedback on card play decisions
5. **Visual Animations** - Cards don't animate to center
6. **Sound Effects** - No audio feedback
7. **Save/Load** - Cannot save game mid-play
8. **Legal Card Highlighting** - No visual indicator of playable cards
9. **Better Error Messages** - Generic error messages for illegal plays

#### Priority Rationale

**LOW** because:
- Core gameplay works
- These are polish/UX enhancements
- Not blocking MVP launch
- Can gather user feedback on which features are most wanted

#### Implementation Plan

**Post-Launch Survey:**
- "Which feature would improve your experience most?"
- Prioritize top 3 based on votes
- Implement in Phase 2-3

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks per feature

## ‚úÖ RESOLVED BUGS

### BUG-007: Card Play Validation Missing ‚úÖ FIXED

**Severity:** üî¥ Critical (was)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
**Fixed:** 2025-10-18
**Documentation:** `BUG_REPORT_IMPOSSIBLE_CARD_PLAY_2025-10-18.md` lines 140-175

#### Problem Description

No validation that AI-chosen card was actually in hand before playing it. If AI had a bug and returned invalid card:
1. Card added to trick (state corruption)
2. `hand.cards.remove(card)` throws ValueError
3. Game state now inconsistent

#### Fix Applied

Added comprehensive validation at `server.py:1583-1615`:

```python
# Validate card is in hand
if card not in hand.cards:
    return jsonify({"error": "AI validation failure"}), 500

# Validate card is legal
if not is_legal_play(card, hand, current_trick, trump):
    return jsonify({"error": "AI chose illegal card"}), 500

# Only then add to trick and remove from hand
```

#### Verification

- [x] Code review confirms validation in place
- [x] Test case verifies error handling
- [x] Production deployment complete

**Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved and Deployed

---

### BUG-008: Auto-Bidding After "Deal New Hand" ‚úÖ FIXED

**Severity:** üî¥ Critical (was)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
**Fixed:** 2025-10-16
**Documentation:** `IMPROVEMENTS_2025-10-16.md` lines 1-55

#### Problem Description

When user clicked "Deal New Hand", the system automatically bid for ALL positions including the user's (South), completely locking out the user.

#### Root Cause

`dealNewHand()` called `resetAuction(data)` without `skipInitialAiBidding` parameter, defaulting to starting AI bidding immediately.

#### Fix Applied

Updated three functions to pass `skipInitialAiBidding = true`:
- `dealNewHand()` (line 660)
- `handleLoadScenario()` (line 674)
- `handleReplayHand()` (line 681)

#### Verification

- [x] After "Deal New Hand", user can bid their own hand
- [x] AI only bids when it's AI player's turn
- [x] Works for all dealer positions

**Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved and Deployed

### BUG-009: Weak 1NT Overcall Logic Too Conservative ‚úÖ FIXED

**Severity:** üü° High (was)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
**Fixed:** 2025-10-16
**Documentation:** `IMPROVEMENTS_2025-10-16.md` lines 57-111

#### Problem Description

AI passed with perfect 1NT overcall hands (15 HCP, balanced, marginal stopper) due to overly strict stopper requirements.

**Example:**
```
Hand: ‚ô†A98 ‚ô•J76 ‚ô¶Q74 ‚ô£AKJ6
HCP: 15, Shape: 4-3-3-3
Stopper: ‚ô•J76 (Jxx)

Expected: 1NT overcall
Actual: Pass ‚ùå
```

#### Root Cause

`_has_stopper()` required Jxxx (4+ cards), rejecting Jxx even with 15+ HCP.

#### Fix Applied

**File:** `backend/engine/overcalls.py` lines 152-191

Accepted marginal stoppers with strong hands:
```python
if hand.hcp >= 15:
    if 'J' in ranks and length >= 3:  # Jxx acceptable
        return True
    if 'Q' in ranks and length >= 2:  # Qx acceptable
        return True
```

#### Verification

- [x] 15 HCP with Jxx now bids 1NT
- [x] Weak hands with Jxx still pass
- [x] AI bidding more aggressive appropriately

**Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved and Deployed
