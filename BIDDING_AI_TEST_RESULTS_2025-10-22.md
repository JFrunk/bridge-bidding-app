# Bridge Bidding AI - 100 Hand Test Results

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Test Type:** Comprehensive 100-hand automated bidding simulation
**Test Duration:** ~2 minutes

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS ATTENTION**

The bidding AI successfully completed 100 hands but showed **HIGH severity issues** with illegal bid attempts in **37% of hands** (37/100). While the safety mechanisms caught these issues and prevented crashes, the underlying bid selection logic needs improvement.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Clean Hands** | 63/100 (63%) | üü° Acceptable |
| **Hands with Issues** | 37/100 (37%) | üü† High |
| **Total Illegal Bids** | 42 attempts | üü† High |
| **Convention Compliance** | 100% | ‚úÖ Good |
| **Crashes/Failures** | 0 | ‚úÖ Excellent |

---

## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Test Execution

The test ran 100 random hands through the complete bidding auction using the [backend/simulation_enhanced.py](backend/simulation_enhanced.py) script.

**Command used:**
```bash
cd backend && PYTHONPATH=. python3 simulation_enhanced.py
```

**Outputs Generated:**
- `simulation_results.json` - Structured data for analysis (804KB)
- `simulation_results.txt` - Human-readable auction results
- Console warnings captured for analysis

### 2. Auction Statistics

| Contract Type | Count | Percentage |
|--------------|-------|-----------|
| **Slam Contracts** (6+ level) | 6 | 6.0% |
| **Game Contracts** (3-5 level) | 46 | 46.0% |
| **Part Scores** (1-2 level) | 47 | 47.0% |
| **Passed Out** (all pass) | 1 | 1.0% |

- **Total bids made:** 889
- **Average bids per hand:** 8.9
- **Competitive auctions:** 37/100 (37%)

**Assessment:** Auction distribution looks reasonable and realistic for bridge.

### 3. Convention Usage

| Convention | Instances | Compliance |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Blackwood** (4NT) | 6 hands | ‚úÖ 100% compliant |
| **Preempts** (Weak 2s) | 2 hands | ‚úÖ 100% compliant |
| **Stayman** | 0 detected | N/A |
| **Jacoby Transfer** | 0 detected | N/A |

**Note:** Limited convention usage may indicate conservative bidding or insufficient scenario-based hands (scenarios.json not found during test).

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue #1: Opener's Rebid Module (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Impact:** 18 illegal bids (42.9% of all issues)

**Most Common Illegal Bids:**
- 2NT - 6 times
- 3NT - 2 times
- 1‚ô† - 2 times
- 3‚ô•, 3‚ô†, 3‚ô¶, 2‚ô£, 2‚ô¶ - 1 time each

**Root Cause:** Rebid logic not checking if bid level is legal when opponents have intervened.

**Example Scenario:**
```
Auction: 1‚ô£ - 2‚ô• - Pass - ?
Opener tries to rebid 2NT (illegal, must be 3-level or higher)
System overrides to Pass
```

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Add minimum legal bid calculation based on last bid in auction
2. Adjust rebid candidate selection to only consider legal bids
3. Add unit tests for competitive rebid scenarios

**Code Location:** [backend/engine/ai/modules/openers_rebid.py](backend/engine/ai/modules/openers_rebid.py)

---

### Issue #2: Response Module (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Impact:** 16 illegal bids (38.1% of all issues)

**Most Common Illegal Bids:**
- 2NT - 5 times
- 3‚ô£ - 3 times
- 4‚ô£ - 2 times
- Others - 6 times

**Root Cause:** Response logic not accounting for intervening bids from opponents.

**Example Scenario:**
```
Auction: 1‚ô¶ - 2‚ô† - ?
Responder tries 2NT (illegal, must be 3-level)
System overrides to Pass
```

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Update response calculations to consider minimum legal bid level
2. When opponent intervenes, recalculate minimum legal response
3. Test with various intervention levels (overcalls, doubles)

**Code Location:** [backend/engine/ai/modules/responses.py](backend/engine/ai/modules/responses.py)

---

### Issue #3: Advancer Bids Module (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Impact:** 7 illegal bids (16.7% of all issues)

**Most Common Illegal Bids:**
- 3‚ô† - 3 times
- 1NT, 3‚ô•, 3‚ô£, 4‚ô¶ - 1 time each

**Root Cause:** Advancer (partner of overcaller) logic not properly tracking auction level.

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Review advancer bid selection to ensure legal level
2. Add context awareness of partner's overcall and subsequent bidding
3. Test advancer responses in competitive sequences

**Code Location:** [backend/engine/ai/modules/advancer_bids.py](backend/engine/ai/modules/advancer_bids.py)

## Bid Pattern Analysis

### Illegal Bid Breakdown

**By Type:**
- No Trump bids: 16 (38.1%)
- Suit bids: 26 (61.9%)

**By Level:**
- Level 1: 5 bids (11.9%)
- Level 2: 16 bids (38.1%)
- Level 3: 16 bids (38.1%)
- Level 4: 5 bids (11.9%)

**Key Insight:** Most illegal bids are at the 2-3 level, suggesting issues with competitive auction tracking after opponent intervention at the 2-level.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Common Pattern Identified

The core issue across all three problematic modules is:

**Modules calculate bids in a vacuum without considering the current minimum legal bid level.**

When opponents intervene with an overcall (e.g., 2‚ô•), the modules still try to suggest bids below that level (e.g., 2‚ô£, 2‚ô¶, 1NT) which are illegal.

### System Safety Mechanism

‚úÖ **Good News:** The bidding engine has a safety catch that detects illegal bids and overrides them to Pass. This prevents crashes but results in overly conservative bidding.

‚ùå **Problem:** Falling back to Pass means losing bidding opportunities and potentially missing good contracts.

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Priority 1: Critical Fixes (Start Here)

#### 1. Create Centralized Bid Validation Helper

**Implementation:**
```python
def get_minimum_legal_bid(auction):
    """
    Calculate the minimum legal bid based on auction history.
    Returns: (min_level, min_strain) or None if no constraint
    """
    # Find last non-Pass/Double/Redouble bid
    # Return minimum level and strain

def is_legal_bid(bid, auction):
    """
    Check if a bid is legal given the current auction.
    Returns: bool
    """
    min_level, min_strain = get_minimum_legal_bid(auction)
    # Compare bid to minimum
    return bid_is_higher_than(bid, min_level, min_strain)

def filter_legal_bids(candidate_bids, auction):
    """
    Filter list of candidate bids to only legal ones.
    Returns: list of legal bids
    """
    return [bid for bid in candidate_bids if is_legal_bid(bid, auction)]
```

**Location:** Create new file [backend/engine/bidding_validation.py](backend/engine/bidding_validation.py)

**Impact:** All modules can use this to pre-filter bids before returning them.

---

#### 2. Fix Opener's Rebid Module

**File:** [backend/engine/ai/modules/openers_rebid.py](backend/engine/ai/modules/openers_rebid.py)

**Changes Needed:**
1. Import `filter_legal_bids` helper
2. Calculate candidate rebids as before
3. Filter candidates through legal bid check
4. If no legal bids, then Pass

**Example:**
```python
# Before returning rebid:
legal_candidates = filter_legal_bids(candidate_rebids, auction)
if not legal_candidates:
    return 'Pass', 'No legal rebid available'
return choose_best(legal_candidates)
```

---

#### 3. Fix Response Module

**File:** [backend/engine/ai/modules/responses.py](backend/engine/ai/modules/responses.py)

**Changes Needed:**
1. Same pattern as opener's rebid
2. Generate candidate responses
3. Filter for legality
4. Select best from legal options

---

### Priority 2: Improve Fallback Logic

Instead of always falling back to Pass when a bid is illegal, implement smarter fallback:

1. If 2NT is illegal, try 3NT
2. If 3‚ô£ is illegal, try 3NT or 3 of next higher suit
3. Only Pass if no legal alternative exists

**Implementation Location:** [backend/engine/bidding_engine.py](backend/engine/bidding_engine.py) - update the illegal bid catch

---

### Priority 3: Add Comprehensive Testing

Create test suite for competitive auctions:

**File:** Create [backend/tests/integration/test_competitive_bidding.py](backend/tests/integration/test_competitive_bidding.py)

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Opener rebids after 2-level overcall
2. Responder bids after intervention
3. Advancer supports overcall
4. Multiple levels of competition
5. Jump overcalls (e.g., 1‚ô¶ - 3‚ô†)

**Test Approach:**
```python
def test_opener_rebid_after_overcall():
    """Opener must bid at 3-level after 2-level overcall"""
    auction = ['1‚ô£', '2‚ô•', 'Pass', '?']
    # Generate opener's hand
    # Get rebid
    # Assert rebid is legal (3-level or Pass)
```

---

### Priority 4: Create Auction State Helper

**File:** Create [backend/engine/auction_state.py](backend/engine/auction_state.py)

**Purpose:** Provide rich context about auction state

```python
class AuctionState:
    def __init__(self, auction):
        self.auction = auction
        self.min_legal_level = self._calc_min_level()
        self.min_legal_strain = self._calc_min_strain()
        self.last_bidder = self._get_last_bidder()
        self.is_competitive = self._is_competitive()

    def is_legal(self, bid):
        """Check if bid is legal"""

    def get_legal_bids(self, candidate_bids):
        """Filter to legal bids"""
```

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for auction state
- Easier to unit test
- Can be extended with more context (forcing bids, alerts, etc.)

---

### Priority 5: Improve Logging and Monitoring

**Current:** Console warnings show illegal bids but limited context

**Improvement:**
1. Add detailed logging when illegal bid is caught
2. Log the hand, auction context, and why bid was illegal
3. Create aggregated metrics dashboard
4. Track illegal bid rate over time

**File:** Update [backend/engine/bidding_engine.py](backend/engine/bidding_engine.py)

```python
def log_illegal_bid(module, bid, auction, hand_context):
    """Log detailed information about illegal bid attempt"""
    logger.warning(f"Illegal bid attempt: {module} suggested {bid}")
    logger.debug(f"Auction: {auction}")
    logger.debug(f"Hand: {hand_context}")
    logger.debug(f"Minimum legal: {get_minimum_legal_bid(auction)}")

    # Optionally save to database for analysis
    save_illegal_bid_metric(module, bid, auction)
```

---

## Testing Workflow Going Forward

### Recommended Testing Process

1. **Make fixes to one module at a time**
2. **Run unit tests** for that module
3. **Run 100-hand simulation** to measure improvement
4. **Compare results** to this baseline
5. **Iterate** until issue rate < 5%

### Commands to Run

```bash
# 1. Run 100-hand simulation
cd backend
PYTHONPATH=. python3 simulation_enhanced.py

# 2. Analyze results (from root directory)
python3 analyze_warnings.py

# 3. Check convention compliance
python3 backend/analyze_simulation_compliance.py

# 4. Run unit tests
PYTHONPATH=backend python3 -m pytest backend/tests/unit/
```

### Success Criteria

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Clean hands | 63% | **>95%** |
| Illegal bid rate | 37% | **<5%** |
| Convention compliance | 100% | **100%** |
| Crashes | 0 | **0** |

---

## Alternative: More Advanced Approach

If issues persist after basic fixes, consider:

### 1. Monte Carlo Bid Selection

Instead of rule-based bid selection:
1. Generate multiple candidate bids
2. Simulate each candidate's outcome
3. Score each outcome (contract quality, making it, points)
4. Select bid with best expected value

**Pros:** More robust, self-correcting
**Cons:** Computationally expensive, complex to implement

### 2. Machine Learning-Based Bidding

Train a neural network on expert bidding sequences:
1. Collect dataset of expert hands + auctions
2. Train model to predict next bid
3. Model learns legal bid constraints implicitly

**Pros:** Can achieve expert-level bidding
**Cons:** Requires large dataset, training infrastructure, harder to debug

### 3. Constraint Satisfaction Approach

Model bidding as constraint satisfaction problem:
1. Define constraints (legal bids, partnership agreements)
2. Define objectives (reach game, find fit, compete)
3. Use constraint solver to find optimal bid

**Pros:** Formally correct, handles complex constraints
**Cons:** Can be slow, requires expertise to model
