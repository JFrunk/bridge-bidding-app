---

## 5-Minute Test

### Test 1: Verify Dealer Indicator
1. Click "Deal Hand to Bid"
2. Look at bidding table header
3. ✅ **Expected**: One position has 🔵 emoji (North for hand 1)

### Test 2: Verify Turn Messages
1. Watch the bidding area
2. ✅ **Expected**: See "⏳ Waiting for North to bid..." (or whatever position is dealer)
3. When it's your turn, see "✅ Your turn to bid!"

### Test 3: Try to Bid Out of Turn
1. On hand 1, North is dealer
2. Try clicking bidding box buttons BEFORE North bids
3. ✅ **Expected**: Nothing happens (buttons may be disabled)
4. Wait for North to bid
5. ✅ **Expected**: After North → East bids, you can bid

### Test 4: Test All 4 Dealers

| Hand | Dealer | Bidding Order | Your Turn |
|------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| 1    | North  | N → E → **S** → W | 3rd |
| 2    | East   | E → **S** → W → N | 2nd |
| 3    | **South** | **S** → W → N → E | 1st (immediate) |
| 4    | West   | W → N → E → **S** | 4th (last) |

To test:
1. Play through hand 1 completely (bid → play → score → "Deal Next Hand")
2. Repeat for hands 2, 3, 4
3. Verify dealer rotates: N → E → S → W

### Test 5: Verify Visual Feedback
1. During bidding, check:
   - ✅ Current player column has yellow/gold highlight
   - ✅ Highlight pulses (subtle animation)
   - ✅ Dealer has 🔵 emoji
   - ✅ Turn message appears and pulses when it's your turn

## Test the Bug Fix

### Original Bug (Now Fixed)
On hand 4 (West dealer), user could bid first even though West should bid first.

### How to Test
1. Play through 3 hands to reach hand 4
2. Verify West has 🔵 emoji
3. Try to click bidding box buttons immediately
4. ✅ **Expected**: Either nothing happens OR you see error "⚠️ Not your turn! Waiting for West to bid."
5. Wait for West → North → East to bid
6. ✅ **Expected**: After East bids, you get "✅ Your turn to bid!" and can bid
