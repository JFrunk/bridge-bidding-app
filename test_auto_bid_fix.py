"""
Test to verify that the AI does not automatically bid for South (user position).

This test simulates the scenario from the bug report where:
1. North opens 1‚ô†
2. East passes
3. South's turn arrives - AI should NOT bid for South

Expected behavior:
- Auction should stop with only 2 bids (North: 1‚ô†, East: Pass)
- South should be waiting for user input
- No automatic Pass should be generated for South
