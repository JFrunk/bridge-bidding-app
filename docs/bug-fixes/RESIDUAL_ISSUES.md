## 🟡 MONITORING: First Hand After Server Startup - Illegal Bidding Sequence

**Status:** Monitoring - Not reproduced since October 2025
**Severity:** 🟡 Moderate (downgraded from Critical)
**Priority:** MEDIUM (downgraded from HIGH)
**Area:** Server/API
**Reported:** 2025-10-10
**Last Review:** 2026-01-01
**Evidence:** `backend/review_requests/hand_2025-10-10_16-25-00.json`

### Problem Description

On the first hand dealt after server startup, all three AI players (North, East, South) bid **1NT** sequentially, which violates bridge bidding rules (cannot bid at same level unless higher denomination).

**Observed Behavior:**
```
Auction: [1NT, 1NT, 1NT, Pass]
- North: 1NT (correct - 17 HCP, balanced 2-4-3-4)
- East: 1NT (ILLEGAL - should Pass or overcall at 2-level)
- South: 1NT (ILLEGAL - same issue)
- West: Pass
```

### Root Cause Analysis

All three AI players received **North's hand** (17 HCP, 2-4-3-4 distribution) instead of their own hands:
- North had 17 HCP, balanced (correct to bid 1NT)
- East had 9 HCP, balanced (should Pass over 1NT)
- South had 8 HCP (should respond to partner's 1NT, not open 1NT)
- West had 6 HCP (correct to Pass)

**Evidence:**
- All three explanations show identical hand data: "HCP: 17 (requires 15-17), Distribution: 2-4-3-4"
- The review request file shows correct hands were dealt and saved
- Bug occurs during bidding, not during dealing

### Investigation Findings

**What's NOT the issue:**
1. ✅ Hand dealing logic works correctly (creates 4 different Hand objects)
2. ✅ Hands are correctly saved to `current_deal` dictionary
3. ✅ Bidding engine logic works when given correct hands
4. ✅ Legality checking exists and functions properly

**What IS the issue:**
- Backend's `/api/get-next-bid` endpoint returns North's hand for all players
- Likely caused by one of:
  1. **Race condition**: Multiple AI requests fire before state updates complete
  2. **State management bug**: `current_deal` global variable access issue
  3. **Parameter passing bug**: `current_player` not correctly sent/received
  4. **Frontend state capture**: `const currentPlayer = players[nextPlayerIndex]` captures stale values

### Reproduction Status

- ❌ Could not reliably reproduce in testing
- ❌ Appears to be intermittent/timing-dependent
- ❌ Not observed since October 2025
- ✅ Happens specifically on first hand after server startup (when it occurs)

### Current Status (2026-01-01)

This issue has not been reproduced in over 2 months. Downgrading to **Monitoring** status. If it recurs:
1. Check server logs for the specific request sequence
2. Review AI bidding race condition fix (see `AI_BIDDING_RACE_CONDITION_FIX.md`)
3. Escalate to Critical if observed again

### Files to Review

- `backend/server.py` - `/api/get-next-bid` endpoint
- `backend/server.py` - `current_deal` global initialization
- `frontend/src/App.js` - AI bidding loop
- `backend/engine/bidding_engine.py` - Legality checking

## ✅ FIXED: Card Play Phase Failed to Start (KeyError)

**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Severity:** ~~🔴 Critical~~ Fixed
**Priority:** ~~HIGH~~ RESOLVED
**Area:** Server/API
**Reported:** 2025-10-10 15:36:50
**Evidence:** `docs/bug-fixes/BUG_FIX_CARD_PLAY.md`

### Problem Description

When bidding completed, clicking to start card play phase resulted in HTTP 500 error with `KeyError: 'N'`.

### Root Cause

Key naming mismatch: `current_deal` uses full names ('North', 'East', etc.) but play phase code tried to access with single letters ('N', 'E', etc.).

### Solution Implemented

Added position name mapping in `server.py`:
```python
pos_map = {'N': 'North', 'E': 'East', 'S': 'South', 'W': 'West'}
```

### Files Changed

- `backend/server.py` - Added position mapping

## ✅ FIXED: Weak Two Preempts with Voids

**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Severity:** ~~🟡 Moderate~~ Fixed
**Priority:** ~~HIGH~~ RESOLVED
**Area:** Bidding Engine
**Reported:** 2025-10-10
**Evidence:** `docs/bug-fixes/BIDDING_FIXES_2025-10-10.md`

### Problem Description

System allowed weak 2-level preempts with voids and 4-card side majors, violating SAYC rules.

### Example

North opened 2♥ with: ♠AJ5 ♥QJ862 ♦J965 ♣void (VOID in clubs - should Pass)

### Solution Implemented

Added `_is_valid_weak_two()` method checking for:
- No voids
- No singleton aces
- No 4-card side major

### Files Changed

- `backend/engine/ai/conventions/preempts.py`

## ✅ FIXED: Strong Balanced Hands (19+ HCP) Passed Instead of Doubling

**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Severity:** ~~🟡 Moderate~~ Fixed
**Priority:** ~~HIGH~~ RESOLVED
**Area:** Bidding Engine
**Reported:** 2025-10-10
**Evidence:** `docs/bug-fixes/BIDDING_FIXES_2025-10-10.md`

### Problem Description

With 19+ HCP balanced hands, system passed after opponent opened instead of competing.

### Example

West passed with: ♠Q982 ♥A7 ♦AKT ♣AQ76 (19 HCP, balanced - should Double)

### Solution Implemented

Updated `TakeoutDoubleConvention` to double with 19+ HCP balanced, planning to bid NT later.

### Files Changed

- `backend/engine/ai/conventions/takeout_doubles.py`
