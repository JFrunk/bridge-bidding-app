# Explicit State Machine Implementation

**Date:** 2025-01-13
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Backend Only)

## Overview

Implemented an explicit state machine for game phases to improve game flow control and prevent invalid operations. This was identified as a high-priority improvement in the bridge play audit (Priority 2).

## What Was Implemented

### 1. GamePhase Enum (`backend/engine/play_engine.py`)

Created explicit enumeration of all game phases:
- `SETUP` - Initial state, no deal yet
- `DEALING` - Cards being dealt
- `BIDDING` - Auction in progress
- `BIDDING_COMPLETE` - Auction ended, contract determined
- `PLAY_STARTING` - Opening lead about to be made
- `PLAY_IN_PROGRESS` - Cards being played
- `PLAY_COMPLETE` - All 13 tricks played
- `SCORING` - Calculating final score
- `ROUND_COMPLETE` - Hand complete, ready for next

**Helper Properties:**
- `is_play_phase` - Check if in any play state
- `is_bidding_phase` - Check if in bidding
- `allows_card_play` - Check if card play allowed
- `allows_bidding` - Check if bidding allowed

### 2. PlayState Phase Tracking

**New Fields:**
- `phase: GamePhase = GamePhase.PLAY_STARTING` - Current game phase
- (Already had `current_trick_leader` from previous fix)

**New Methods:**
- `transition_to(new_phase)` - Validate and transition to new phase
- `can_play_card()` - Check if card play allowed in current phase
- `update_phase_after_card()` - Auto-update phase after card played

### 3. Server Integration (`backend/server.py`)

**Updated Endpoints:**

1. `/api/start-play` (line 555)
   - Sets initial phase to `PLAY_STARTING`

2. `/api/play-card` (lines 601-605, 633-634)
   - Validates phase allows card play before accepting card
   - Auto-updates phase after each card played

3. `/api/get-ai-play` (lines 705-709, 724-725)
   - Validates phase allows card play
   - Auto-updates phase after AI card played

4. `/api/get-play-state` (line 826)
   - Includes current phase in response

5. `/api/clear-trick` (line 855)
   - Returns updated phase after clearing

### 4. Phase Transitions

**Valid Transitions:**
```
SETUP → DEALING
DEALING → BIDDING
BIDDING → BIDDING_COMPLETE
BIDDING_COMPLETE → PLAY_STARTING
PLAY_STARTING → PLAY_IN_PROGRESS (after first card)
PLAY_IN_PROGRESS → PLAY_IN_PROGRESS (during play)
PLAY_IN_PROGRESS → PLAY_COMPLETE (after 13 tricks)
PLAY_COMPLETE → SCORING
SCORING → ROUND_COMPLETE
ROUND_COMPLETE → SETUP | DEALING (new round)
```

**Automatic Transitions:**
- `PLAY_STARTING → PLAY_IN_PROGRESS` - After first card played
- `PLAY_IN_PROGRESS → PLAY_COMPLETE` - When all 13 tricks complete

**Validation:**
- Invalid transitions raise `ValueError` with clear error message
- Prevents playing cards in wrong phases (bidding, scoring, etc.)

## Testing

### Test Coverage (`backend/tests/unit/test_game_phase.py`)

**13 comprehensive tests:**

1. **GamePhase Enum Tests (5 tests)**
   - String representation
   - `is_play_phase` property
   - `is_bidding_phase` property
   - `allows_card_play` property
   - `allows_bidding` property

2. **Phase Transition Tests (6 tests)**
   - All valid transitions work
   - Invalid transitions raise ValueError
   - `can_play_card()` method works
   - Auto-update after first card
   - Auto-update stays in progress
   - Auto-update to complete after 13 tricks

3. **Integration Tests (2 tests)**
   - Full play sequence phase updates
   - Phase validation prevents invalid play

**Test Results:** ✅ All 13 tests pass

## Benefits

1. **Clear State Tracking** - Explicit phase enum instead of implicit state
2. **Validation** - Prevents invalid operations (e.g., playing cards during bidding)
3. **Automatic Transitions** - Phase updates automatically during play
4. **Error Prevention** - Invalid transitions caught with clear error messages
5. **Debugging** - Easy to see current phase in API responses and logs
6. **Future-Proof** - Foundation for undo/redo, claims, and other features

## Frontend Integration (Deferred)

**Note:** Per user request, frontend changes were deferred due to ongoing UI refactoring.

**When frontend is ready:**
- Use `phase` field from `/api/get-play-state` response
- Show appropriate UI for each phase
- Display phase-specific messages/instructions
- Disable/enable controls based on phase

## Files Changed

1. `backend/engine/play_engine.py` - GamePhase enum and PlayState methods
2. `backend/server.py` - Endpoint integration
3. `backend/tests/unit/test_game_phase.py` - Comprehensive test suite (NEW)

## Next Steps (Priority 2 Items)

Per audit recommendations, remaining Priority 2 items:

1. **Board Vulnerability Auto-calculation** (~1 hour)
   - Auto-calculate vulnerability based on board number
   - Chicago scoring support

2. **Claims Mechanism** (~4 hours)
   - Allow declarer to claim remaining tricks
   - Validate claim is reasonable

3. **Honors Scoring** (~2 hours)
   - Add honors bonuses (4 honors = 100, 5 honors = 150)
   - Only applicable in suit contracts

4. **Undo/Redo** (~8 hours)
   - Allow taking back moves
   - Requires state history tracking
   - State machine makes this easier

## Metrics

- **Implementation Time:** ~1 hour (backend only)
- **Test Coverage:** 13 unit tests, all passing
- **Lines of Code:**
  - `play_engine.py`: +73 lines (GamePhase enum + methods)
  - `server.py`: +16 lines (validation + integration)
  - `test_game_phase.py`: +317 lines (comprehensive tests)
- **Breaking Changes:** None (backward compatible)
- **API Changes:**
  - Added `phase` field to `/api/get-play-state` response
  - Added `phase` field to `/api/clear-trick` response
  - Added validation errors for invalid phase operations
