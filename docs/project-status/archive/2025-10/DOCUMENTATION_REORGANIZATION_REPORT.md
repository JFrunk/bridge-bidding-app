## Recommendations for Ongoing Maintenance

### Documentation Standards
1. **New Documents:**
   - Bug fixes → `docs/bug-fixes/`
   - Phase milestones → `docs/development-phases/`
   - Feature implementations → `docs/features/`
   - Testing/usage guides → `docs/guides/`
   - Technical architecture → `docs/architecture/`

2. **Naming Conventions:**
   - `FEATURE_NAME.md` for features
   - `PHASE#_DESCRIPTION.md` for phases
   - `BUG_FIX_AREA.md` or `FIX_DESCRIPTION.md` for bug fixes
   - `SUBJECT_GUIDE.md` for guides

3. **Update Process:**
   - When creating new docs, immediately add to docs/README.md
   - When completing phases, move summary docs to development-phases/
   - When fixing bugs, document in bug-fixes/
   - Review and archive debug documents when issues resolved

### Periodic Reviews
- **Weekly:** Check for misplaced documents during active development
- **Monthly:** Review debug-archive for documents that can be deleted
- **Phase Completion:** Update all indexes and feature summaries
- **Major Releases:** Comprehensive documentation audit (like this one)
