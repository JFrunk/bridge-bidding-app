## 🧪 Quick Test

Want to verify it's working? Run this after making a bid:

```bash
cd /Users/simonroy/Desktop/bridge_bidding_app/backend

# Check practice history
sqlite3 bridge.db "SELECT id, user_bid, correct_bid, was_correct, xp_earned, timestamp FROM practice_history ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;"

# Check user stats
sqlite3 bridge.db "SELECT total_xp, current_level, total_hands_practiced, current_streak_days FROM user_gamification WHERE user_id = 1;"
```

# Make a bid, watch for "Analytics recording" messages
```

### Method 2: Query Database Directly
```bash
cd /Users/simonroy/Desktop/bridge_bidding_app/backend

# Show all practice history
sqlite3 bridge.db "SELECT * FROM practice_history;"

# Show user stats
sqlite3 bridge.db "SELECT * FROM user_gamification WHERE user_id = 1;"

# Show patterns
sqlite3 bridge.db "SELECT * FROM mistake_patterns WHERE user_id = 1;"
```

### Method 3: Check Dashboard
1. Make a bid
2. Click "📊 My Progress"
3. Look for:
   - XP increase
   - Hands count increase
   - Accuracy calculation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Updating?

**Check 1:** Verify practice was recorded
```bash
sqlite3 backend/bridge.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM practice_history WHERE user_id = 1;"
# Should be > 0 after bidding
```

**Check 2:** Check for errors
```bash
tail -50 /tmp/server_final.log | grep -i error
```

**Check 3:** Hard refresh dashboard
```
Close modal
Refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
Click "📊 My Progress" again
```

### XP Not Increasing?

**Make sure:**
- You're making bids as South (the human player)
- Server restarted after code changes
- No database errors in logs

### Patterns Not Appearing?

**Remember:**
- Patterns only appear for **incorrect bids**
- Need multiple similar mistakes to form a pattern
- Takes 5-10 incorrect bids to see patterns
