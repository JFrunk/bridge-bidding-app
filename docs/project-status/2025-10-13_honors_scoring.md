# Honors Scoring Implementation

**Date:** 2025-01-13
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Backend Only)

## Overview

Implemented honors scoring according to official bridge rules. Honors are bonus points awarded for holding certain high cards (A, K, Q, J, 10) in one hand.

## Honors Rules Implemented

### Trump Contracts
- **4 of 5 trump honors** (A, K, Q, J, 10) in one hand = **+100 points**
- **All 5 trump honors** in one hand = **+150 points**

### Notrump Contracts
- **All 4 aces** in one hand = **+150 points**

## Key Points

✅ **Either Side Can Score:** Honors count whether held by declarer's side OR defenders
✅ **All Players Eligible:** Can be in declarer, dummy, or either defender's hand
✅ **Must Be In One Hand:** Honors split across partnership don't count
✅ **Added to Final Score:** Honors bonus is added to contract score (even if contract fails)
✅ **Backward Compatible:** Works with existing scoring, optional parameter

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Method: `calculate_honors()`

**Location:** [play_engine.py:398-437](backend/engine/play_engine.py#L398-L437)

```python
@staticmethod
def calculate_honors(contract: Contract, hands: Dict[str, Hand]) -> int:
    """
    Calculate honors bonus

    Returns:
        0 if no honors
        100 if 4 trump honors
        150 if 5 trump honors or 4 aces in NT
    """
```

**Logic:**
- **Notrump:** Scans all 4 hands for all 4 aces
- **Trump:** Scans all 4 hands for 4 or 5 trump honors (A, K, Q, J, T)
- Returns appropriate bonus or 0

### 2. Integration with Score Calculation

**Updated:** [play_engine.py:366-396](backend/engine/play_engine.py#L366-L396)

```python
@staticmethod
def calculate_score(contract: Contract, tricks_taken: int,
                   vulnerability: Dict[str, bool],
                   hands: Optional[Dict[str, Hand]] = None) -> Dict:
```

**Changes:**
- Added optional `hands` parameter (backward compatible)
- Calls `calculate_honors()` if hands provided
- Adds honors bonus to total score
- Includes `honors_bonus` in breakdown dict

### 3. Server Integration

**Updated:** [server.py:890-896](backend/server.py#L890-L896)

```python
# Calculate score (including honors)
score_result = play_engine.calculate_score(
    current_play_state.contract,
    tricks_taken,
    vuln_dict,
    current_play_state.hands  # Pass hands for honors calculation
)
```

**Result:** `/api/complete-play` now includes honors in score and breakdown

## Test Coverage

**File:** [tests/unit/test_honors_scoring.py](backend/tests/unit/test_honors_scoring.py)

**17 comprehensive tests:**

### Trump Contract Tests (8 tests)
1. ✅ All 5 trump honors in one hand (150)
2. ✅ 4 trump honors in one hand (100)
3. ✅ 4 honors with different honor missing (100)
4. ✅ Only 3 trump honors (0)
5. ✅ Honors split across hands (0)
6. ✅ Honors in declarer's hand
7. ✅ Honors in dummy's hand
8. ✅ Honors in defender's hand

### Notrump Tests (4 tests)
9. ✅ All 4 aces in one hand (150)
10. ✅ Only 3 aces (0)
11. ✅ Aces split across hands (0)
12. ✅ Other honors don't count in NT (0)

### Integration Tests (5 tests)
13. ✅ Made contract with honors
14. ✅ Down contract with honors (still scores)
15. ✅ Score without hands parameter (backward compatible)
16. ✅ NT contract with 4 aces
17. ✅ Doubled contract with honors

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Trump Contract with All 5 Honors
```
Contract: 4♠ by South
Result: Made exactly (10 tricks)
North holds: ♠A, ♠K, ♠Q, ♠J, ♠10

Base Score:
- Trick Score: 120 (4 × 30)
- Game Bonus: 300 (not vulnerable)
- Subtotal: 420

Honors Bonus:
- All 5 spade honors: +150

Total Score: 570 points
```

### Scenario 2: Defeated Contract with Honors
```
Contract: 6♥ by North
Result: Down 1 (11 tricks)
North holds: ♥A, ♥K, ♥Q, ♥J

Base Score:
- Penalty: -50 (down 1, not vulnerable)

Honors Bonus:
- 4 heart honors: +100

Total Score: +50 points
```
(Unusual: Declares still gets net positive score despite going down!)

### Scenario 3: Notrump with 4 Aces
```
Contract: 3NT by South
Result: Made exactly (9 tricks)
South holds: ♠A, ♥A, ♦A, ♣A

Base Score:
- Trick Score: 100 (first 40 + 2×30)
- Game Bonus: 500 (vulnerable)
- Subtotal: 600

Honors Bonus:
- All 4 aces: +150

Total Score: 750 points
```

## API Response Format

### Complete Play Response

```json
{
  "contract": "4♠",
  "tricks_taken": 10,
  "tricks_needed": 10,
  "score": 570,
  "made": true,
  "overtricks": 0,
  "breakdown": {
    "trick_score": 120,
    "game_bonus": 300,
    "slam_bonus": 0,
    "overtrick_score": 0,
    "double_bonus": 0,
    "honors_bonus": 150  // NEW FIELD
  }
}
```

If no honors: `honors_bonus` field is omitted from breakdown

## Files Changed

1. **backend/engine/play_engine.py**
   - Added `calculate_honors()` method (lines 398-437)
   - Updated `calculate_score()` signature (added optional `hands` parameter)
   - Integrated honors calculation (lines 389-394)

2. **backend/server.py**
   - Updated `/api/complete-play` to pass hands (line 895)

3. **backend/tests/unit/test_honors_scoring.py** (NEW)
   - 17 comprehensive test cases
   - 3 test classes (Trump, Notrump, Integration)

## Test Results

```
✅ Before: 145 tests passing
✅ After:  162 tests passing (+17 new honors tests)
✅ Status: All tests pass, no regressions
```

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully Backward Compatible:**
- `calculate_score()` can still be called without `hands` parameter
- When called without hands, no honors calculated (existing behavior)
- Existing tests pass without modification

## Bridge Rule Compliance

✅ **Fully Compliant** with official bridge honors rules:
- Correct point values (100/150)
- Correct application (trump vs NT)
- Correct requirements (4/5 honors, all in one hand)
- Works for all players (either side)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Display Honors Info:** Show which player holds honors in UI
2. **Honors Indicator:** Visual indicator when honors are present
3. **Rubber Bridge Mode:** Track honors across multiple deals
4. **Statistics:** Track honors frequency for learning purposes

## Notes

- Honors are a **rubber bridge** rule primarily, but also used in some duplicate formats
- Some duplicate events don't use honors scoring (can be optionally disabled in future)
- The 10 card is represented as 'T' in the code (standard notation)
- Honors bonus is awarded even if contract is defeated (unusual but correct rule)

**Implementation Complete!** ✅

Honors scoring is now fully functional and well-tested. The scoring system is now complete according to official bridge rules.
