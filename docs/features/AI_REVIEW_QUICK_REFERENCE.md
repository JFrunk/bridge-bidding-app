## Tips for Best Results

### Writing Good Concerns

**‚ùå Too Vague**
- "Is this correct?"
- "What do you think?"
- "Help"

**‚úÖ Specific Questions**
- "Should North have opened 1‚ô† or 1NT with this balanced 15 HCP?"
- "Was West's overcall at the 2-level too risky vulnerable?"
- "Should declarer have drawn trumps before establishing diamonds?"

### During Bidding
- Ask about specific bids, not the whole auction
- Mention convention uncertainty if relevant
- Include your reasoning if you have one

### During Playing
- Reference specific tricks or decisions
- Ask about alternative plays
- Question strategy, not just tactics
