# SAYC Bridge Bidding Learning Mode - Complete Curriculum

**Created:** 2025-12-25
**Status:** Planning
**Purpose:** Define the complete sequenced learning path for SAYC bridge bidding

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Sequential Mastery
Users must complete each level before advancing to the next. No skipping.

### 2. Hybrid Practice Approach (Research-Based)
- **Blocked Practice:** First exposure to new topic (build understanding)
- **Interleaved Review:** After 2+ topics learned (build discrimination)
- **Level Assessment:** Mixed test before unlocking next level

### 3. Foundations Before Conventions
Conventions (Level 5+) only make sense after fundamental bidding mechanics (Levels 0-4) are solid.

## Practice Flow Within Each Level

```
TOPIC A (Blocked)
    └── N consecutive hands on Topic A
    └── Must reach 80% accuracy
    └── ✓ Topic A basics understood

TOPIC B (Blocked)
    └── N consecutive hands on Topic B
    └── Must reach 80% accuracy
    └── ✓ Topic B basics understood

REVIEW SESSION (Interleaved)
    └── 10-12 hands mixing Topics A + B
    └── Forces discrimination: "Which approach applies?"

[Continue pattern for remaining topics in level]

LEVEL MASTERY TEST (Interleaved)
    └── 20 hands mixing ALL topics in level
    └── Must score 80% (85% for Level 8)
    └── ✓ LEVEL COMPLETE → Unlock next level
```

## Scorecard Structure

The scorecard tracks:
1. **Per-topic accuracy** within each level
2. **Overall level progress** (topics completed / total)
3. **Weak areas** (topics below 70% accuracy)
4. **Strong areas** (topics above 85% accuracy)
5. **Recommended next action** (continue current topic, review weak area, or level test)

## Implementation Notes

### Existing Infrastructure to Leverage
- ConventionRegistry (levels, prerequisites) - extend for non-convention topics
- SkillTree system - maps well to this 9-level structure
- LearningPath API endpoints - record-practice, progress tracking
- Scenario system - generate hands for each topic

### New Infrastructure Needed
- Topics for Levels 0-4 (fundamentals, not just conventions)
- Hand generation for non-convention topics
- Level assessment (interleaved test) system
- Review session scheduling

### Alignment with Existing 3-Level Convention System
| Existing Level | Maps To |
|----------------|---------|
| Essential | Level 5 |
| Intermediate | Level 7 |
| Advanced | Level 8 |

Levels 0-4 and 6 are new additions for complete curriculum.
