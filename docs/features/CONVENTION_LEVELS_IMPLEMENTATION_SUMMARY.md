# Convention Levels - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ BACKEND COMPLETE

The hybrid convention levels system has been fully implemented on the backend. All core functionality is ready for frontend integration.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Convention Registry System
**File:** `backend/engine/ai/conventions/convention_registry.py`

- **15 Conventions** fully cataloged with metadata
- **3 Difficulty Levels:**
  - Essential (4 conventions) - Must learn
  - Intermediate (5 conventions) - Should learn
  - Advanced (6 conventions) - Expert tools
- **Metadata for each convention:**
  - Name, ID, description
  - Level, category, frequency, complexity
  - Prerequisites (skills/conventions required)
  - Practice requirements (hands needed, passing accuracy)
  - Learning time estimates

**Key Classes:**
- `ConventionMetadata` - Data structure for convention properties
- `ConventionRegistry` - Manager with query and unlock logic
- `ConventionLevel` / `ConventionCategory` - Enums for organization

### 2. Skill Tree Structure
**File:** `backend/engine/learning/skill_tree.py`

- **6-Level Learning Path:**
  - Level 1: Foundations (basic skills)
  - Level 2: Essential Conventions
  - Level 3: Intermediate Bidding
  - Level 4: Intermediate Conventions
  - Level 5: Advanced Bidding
  - Level 6: Advanced Conventions
- **Integrates conventions and skills** into single progression
- **Prerequisite checking** across levels
- **Unlock requirements** clearly defined

**Key Classes:**
- `SkillNode` - Represents a skill in the tree
- `SkillTreeManager` - Manages progression and unlocking
- `SkillType` - Enum for node types

### 3. Database Schema
**Files:**
- `backend/database/schema_convention_levels.sql`
- `backend/database/init_convention_data.py`

**Tables:**
- `conventions` - Convention definitions
- `convention_prerequisites` - Dependencies
- `user_convention_progress` - User status/progress
- `convention_practice_history` - Detailed logging

**Views:**
- `v_user_convention_summary` - Aggregated progress
- `v_user_level_progress` - Level-by-level breakdown

**Features:**
- Automatic status updates (locked ‚Üí unlocked ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí mastered)
- Accuracy tracking
- Practice history with timing
- Indexes for performance

### 4. API Endpoints
**File:** `backend/engine/learning/learning_path_api.py`

**Convention Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/conventions/by-level` - All conventions grouped
- `GET /api/conventions/<id>` - Convention details
- `GET /api/conventions/unlocked?user_id=<id>` - Available conventions
- `GET /api/conventions/next-recommended?user_id=<id>` - Recommendation
- `POST /api/conventions/record-practice` - Log practice result
- `POST /api/conventions/unlock` - Manual unlock

**Progress Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/user/convention-progress?user_id=<id>` - Overall progress

**Skill Tree Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/skill-tree` - Full tree structure
- `GET /api/skill-tree/progress?user_id=<id>` - User's tree progress

## How It Works

### Unlocking System

```
User starts
    ‚Üì
Complete Level 1 Foundations (5 basic skills)
    ‚Üì
‚úì Essential Conventions UNLOCK
    ‚Üì
Complete Stayman (10 hands, 80%+)
Complete Jacoby (10 hands, 80%+)
Complete Weak Two (8 hands, 80%+)
Complete Takeout Double (12 hands, 80%+)
    ‚Üì
‚úì Intermediate Conventions UNLOCK
    ‚Üì
Complete all 5 Intermediate conventions
    ‚Üì
‚úì Advanced Conventions UNLOCK
```

### Progress Tracking

**For Each Convention:**
1. **Locked** - Prerequisites not met
2. **Unlocked** - Available to start
3. **In Progress** - Started practicing
4. **Mastered** - Met passing criteria (hands + accuracy)

**Mastery Criteria:**
- Complete required practice hands
- Achieve passing accuracy (80% or 85%)
- Tracked automatically on each practice attempt

### Recommendation Engine

**Priority Order:**
1. **Level** - Essential > Intermediate > Advanced
2. **Frequency** - Very High > High > Medium > Low

**Example:**
- User mastered: Stayman, Jacoby
- Remaining Essential: Weak Two (High freq), Takeout Double (High freq)
- **Recommended:** Weak Two (comes first alphabetically)

## Integration Requirements

### To Activate in server.py

Add these lines to `backend/server.py`:

```python
# Add import (near top with other imports)
from engine.learning.learning_path_api import register_learning_endpoints

# Register endpoints (after creating app)
app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)
engine = BiddingEngine()

# Add this line
register_learning_endpoints(app)

print("Server running on http://localhost:5001")
```

### Initialize Database

```bash
cd backend
python database/init_convention_data.py
```

### Test API

```bash
# Start server
python server.py

# Test (in another terminal)
curl http://localhost:5001/api/conventions/by-level
curl http://localhost:5001/api/skill-tree
```

---

## Frontend Integration Points

### 1. Convention Learning Page

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/conventions/by-level`

Display three sections:
- ‚≠ê Essential Conventions (4 cards)
- üéØ Intermediate Conventions (5 cards, locked if not ready)
- üëë Advanced Conventions (6 cards, locked if not ready)

Each card shows:
- Convention name
- Frequency/complexity badges
- Short description
- Lock status or progress bar
- "Start Learning" / "Continue" / "Review" button

### 2. User Progress Dashboard

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/user/convention-progress?user_id=<id>`
- `GET /api/skill-tree/progress?user_id=<id>`

Display:
- Overall progress: X / 15 conventions mastered
- Progress bar per level
- Next recommended convention
- Recent practice history

### 3. Practice Mode Integration

**When user practices a convention:**

```javascript
// Record the attempt
fetch('/api/conventions/record-practice', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    user_id: userId,
    convention_id: 'stayman',
    was_correct: true,
    hints_used: 0,
    time_taken_seconds: 45
  })
});

// Check for mastery
const { progress } = await response.json();
if (progress.status === 'mastered') {
  showMasteryModal();
  checkForNewUnlocks();
}
```

### 4. Unlocking Animations

When mastery achieved:
- Show celebration modal
- Display progress toward next level
- If level unlocked, show special animation
- Update available conventions

## Testing Checklist

### Database Initialization
- [x] Schema creates all tables
- [x] Data populates 15 conventions
- [x] Prerequisites link correctly
- [x] Views work properly

### API Endpoints
- [x] `/api/conventions/by-level` returns all conventions
- [x] `/api/conventions/<id>` returns details
- [x] `/api/conventions/unlocked` checks prerequisites
- [x] `/api/conventions/next-recommended` prioritizes correctly
- [x] `/api/conventions/record-practice` updates progress
- [x] `/api/user/convention-progress` aggregates correctly
- [x] `/api/skill-tree` returns full tree
- [x] `/api/skill-tree/progress` calculates correctly

### Unlock Logic
- [ ] Essential unlocks after Level 1 complete
- [ ] Intermediate unlocks after Essential mastered
- [ ] Advanced unlocks after Intermediate mastered
- [ ] Individual prerequisites checked correctly

### Progress Tracking
- [ ] Status transitions: locked ‚Üí unlocked ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí mastered
- [ ] Accuracy calculated correctly
- [ ] Mastery detection works (hands + accuracy)
- [ ] Practice history logs all attempts

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes
- ‚úÖ Indexed on `user_id` in progress tables
- ‚úÖ Indexed on `timestamp` in history table
- ‚úÖ Views use efficient queries

### API Optimization
- Batch queries where possible
- Use views for complex aggregations
- Cache convention metadata (doesn't change)

### Frontend Optimization
- Fetch conventions once, cache in state
- Poll user progress periodically (not every action)
- Update local state optimistically

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **No user authentication** - Assumes user_id passed in
2. **No spaced repetition** - Mastered conventions not scheduled for review
3. **No adaptive difficulty** - All hands same difficulty within convention
4. **No social features** - No leaderboards or comparisons

### Planned Enhancements
1. **Spaced Repetition System**
   - Review mastered conventions at intervals
   - Prevent forgetting with scheduled practice
   - Lower passing threshold for reviews

2. **Adaptive Practice**
   - Increase difficulty as mastery improves
   - Target weak areas within convention
   - Personalized hand generation

3. **Tutorial System**
   - Interactive tutorials before practice
   - Step-by-step convention explanation
   - Guided practice hands

4. **Achievement System**
   - Badges for mastering conventions
   - Bonus XP for perfect practice sets
   - Streak tracking per convention

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- **Target:** 70% of users complete Essential conventions
- **Measure:** Convention completion rate by level

### Learning Effectiveness
- **Target:** 80%+ accuracy on review hands after 30 days
- **Measure:** Retention rate with spaced repetition (when added)

### Time to Competency
- **Target:** Users master Essential in 2-3 hours of practice
- **Measure:** Time from unlock to mastery per convention
