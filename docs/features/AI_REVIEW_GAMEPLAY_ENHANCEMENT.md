# AI Review Feature - Gameplay Phase Enhancement

## Overview

The AI Review feature has been enhanced to capture **complete gameplay data** when a user requests a review during the card play phase. This allows for comprehensive analysis of both the auction and the actual card play, including trick history, remaining cards, and contract details.

## What's New

### Previous Behavior
- AI Review only captured bidding phase data
- No information about card play was recorded
- Review requests during gameplay phase were incomplete

### Enhanced Behavior
- AI Review now detects whether user is in **bidding** or **playing** phase
- During **playing phase**, captures:
  - Complete contract details (level, strain, declarer, doubled status)
  - All trick history (cards played, leader, winner)
  - Current trick in progress
  - Remaining cards in each hand
  - Tricks won by each partnership
  - Opening leader and dummy position
  - Game completion status

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

**File: [server.py](../../backend/server.py:338)**

The `/api/request-review` endpoint now:

1. **Accepts `game_phase` parameter** - 'bidding' or 'playing'
2. **Captures hands from appropriate source**:
   - Bidding phase: Uses `current_deal` (original hands)
   - Playing phase: Uses `current_play_state.hands` (remaining cards)
3. **Adds `play_data` section** when in playing phase with:
   - Contract information
   - Trick history with complete details
   - Current trick state
   - Tricks won statistics
   - Opening leader and dummy position

**Key Code Addition:**
```python
# Add play phase data if in gameplay
if game_phase == 'playing' and current_play_state:
    contract = current_play_state.contract

    # Serialize trick history
    trick_history = []
    for trick in current_play_state.trick_history:
        trick_cards = [
            {
                'card': {'rank': card.rank, 'suit': card.suit},
                'player': player
            }
            for card, player in trick.cards
        ]
        trick_history.append({
            'cards': trick_cards,
            'leader': trick.leader,
            'winner': trick.winner
        })

    review_request['play_data'] = {
        'contract': {...},
        'trick_history': trick_history,
        'current_trick': current_trick,
        'tricks_won': {...},
        # ... more fields
    }
```

### Frontend Changes

**File: [App.js](../../frontend/src/App.js:191)**

The `handleRequestReview` function now:

1. **Passes `game_phase` to backend** in the request
2. **Generates context-aware prompts**:
   - Bidding phase: Focuses on auction analysis
   - Playing phase: Analyzes both auction and card play
3. **Updates modal UI** with phase-appropriate text and placeholders

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
body: JSON.stringify({
  auction_history: auction,
  user_concern: userConcern,
  game_phase: gamePhase  // New: Include current phase
})

// Context-aware prompt generation
if (gamePhase === 'playing') {
  prompt = `Please analyze the gameplay in backend/review_requests/${data.filename}.
  This includes both the auction and card play progress according to SAYC...`;
}
```

## Enhanced Review Request Format
