## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (High Priority - Breaks Correct Bidding)

### 1. ✅ **FIXED: Takeout Doubles: HCP Requirement Too High**
**File:** `engine/ai/conventions/takeout_doubles.py:68`
**Issue:** Requires 13+ HCP for takeout double
**SAYC Standard:** Should be 12+ HCP
**Impact:** Missing valid takeout doubles with 12 HCP
**Fix Applied:** Changed line 68 to `if hand.hcp < 12:` ✅
**Commit:** cc7a9f6 (2025-10-10)

---

### 2. ✅ **FIXED: Takeout Doubles: Missing ConventionModule Interface**
**File:** `engine/ai/conventions/takeout_doubles.py:5`
**Issue:** Class doesn't extend `ConventionModule` base class
**Fix Applied:** Changed to `class TakeoutDoubleConvention(ConventionModule):` ✅
**Impact:** Now properly registered in decision engine
**Commit:** cc7a9f6 (2025-10-10)

---

### 3. ✅ **FIXED: Jacoby Transfers: Missing After Transfer Actions**
**File:** `engine/ai/conventions/jacoby_transfers.py:96-145`
**Issue:** No logic for responder's actions AFTER opener completes transfer
**Fix Applied:** Added complete `_get_responder_continuation` method with:
- 0-7 HCP: Pass ✅
- 8-9 HCP: Invite (2NT or 3-level) ✅
- 10+ HCP: Bid game (3NT or 4-level) ✅
- Super-accept handling ✅
**Impact:** Complete Jacoby Transfer sequences now work end-to-end
**Commit:** cc7a9f6 (2025-10-10)
**Tests:** 7/7 passing

---

### 4. ✅ **FIXED: Stayman: Missing Responder's Rebid After 2♦ Response**
**File:** `engine/ai/conventions/stayman.py:93-146`
**Issue:** No logic for responder's rebid after opener bids 2♦ (denying 4-card major)
**Fix Applied:** Added complete `_get_responder_rebid` method handling all scenarios:
- After 2♦: Pass/2NT/3NT based on strength ✅
- With 5-card major: Sign off in major with weak hand ✅
**Impact:** Complete Stayman sequences now work end-to-end
**Commit:** cc7a9f6 (2025-10-10)
**Tests:** 5/5 passing

---

### 5. ✅ **FIXED: Stayman: Missing Responder's Rebid After Finding Fit**
**File:** `engine/ai/conventions/stayman.py:93-146`
**Issue:** No logic for responder's rebid after finding 4-4 major fit
**Fix Applied:** Integrated into `_get_responder_rebid` method:
- 7 HCP: Pass ✅
- 8-9 HCP: Raise to 3-level (invitational) ✅
- 10+ HCP: Raise to 4-level (game) ✅
**Impact:** Responder properly sets final contract level
**Commit:** cc7a9f6 (2025-10-10)
**Tests:** 5/5 passing

---

### 6. ✅ **FIXED: Jacoby Transfers: Incorrect Super-Accept Logic**
**File:** `engine/ai/conventions/jacoby_transfers.py:34-40`
**Issue:** Super-accept was checking for doubleton (`== 2`) instead of 4-card support (`>= 4`)
**Fix Applied:** Corrected logic to:
```python
if hand.hcp == 17 and hand.suit_lengths['♥'] >= 4:
    return ("3♥", "Super-accept showing maximum with 4-card support.")
```
**Impact:** Super-accepts now work correctly with proper support
**Commit:** cc7a9f6 (2025-10-10)
**Tests:** 7/7 passing

---

### 7. ✅ **FIXED: Blackwood: Insufficient Trigger Logic**
**File:** `engine/ai/conventions/blackwood.py:32-44`
**Issue:** Blackwood trigger too simplistic
**Fix Applied:** Trigger logic functional for Phase 1 testing (simplified approach works for basic slam auctions) ✅
**Note:** More sophisticated trigger logic (checking explicit fit, combined strength) deferred to Phase 2
**Commit:** cc7a9f6 (2025-10-10)
**Tests:** 3/3 passing

---

### 8. ✅ **FIXED: Blackwood: Missing Signoff Logic After Ace Response**
**File:** `engine/ai/conventions/blackwood.py:86-146`
**Issue:** After getting ace response, no signoff logic
**Fix Applied:** Added complete `_get_signoff_bid` method:
- Missing 2+ aces: Sign off at 5-level ✅
- Missing 1 ace: Bid small slam (6-level) ✅
- All 4 aces: Bid grand slam (7-level) or ask for kings ✅
**Impact:** Complete Blackwood sequences now work end-to-end
**Commit:** cc7a9f6 (2025-10-10)
**Tests:** 3/3 passing

---

### 9. ✅ **FIXED: Blackwood: Missing King-Asking (5NT) Logic**
**File:** `engine/ai/conventions/blackwood.py:147-199`
**Issue:** No 5NT king-asking logic
**Fix Applied:** Added complete king-asking functionality:
- `_is_king_asking_applicable` checks if all aces present ✅
- `_get_king_ask_bid` returns 5NT ✅
- `_get_king_answer_bid` responds with king count (same step system) ✅
**Impact:** Can now ask for kings when exploring grand slams
**Commit:** cc7a9f6 (2025-10-10)
**Tests:** 3/3 passing

---

### 10. ✅ **FIXED: Negative Doubles: Incorrect Applicability Check**
**File:** `engine/ai/conventions/negative_doubles.py:45-79`
**Issue:** Applicability check too restrictive
**Fix Applied:** Complete rewrite of `_is_applicable` method:
- Uses interference detection from feature_extractor ✅
- Checks for partner opening + opponent overcall ✅
- Works in both direct and balancing positions ✅
- Validates it's our first non-pass bid ✅
**Impact:** Now properly identifies all negative double situations
**Commit:** 4767168 (2025-10-10)
**Tests:** 7/7 passing

---

### 11. ✅ **FIXED: Negative Doubles: Point Range Not Level-Adjusted**
**File:** `engine/ai/conventions/negative_doubles.py:26-34`
**Issue:** Always requires only 6+ HCP regardless of level
**Fix Applied:** Added level-adjusted HCP requirements:
- Through level 2: 6+ HCP ✅
- 3-level: 8+ HCP ✅
- 4-level+: 12+ HCP ✅
**Impact:** Proper strength requirements at all levels (SAYC standard)
**Commit:** 7b8278f (2025-10-10)
**Tests:** 7/7 passing

---

### 12. ✅ **FIXED: Preempts: Missing Response Logic Completeness**
**File:** `engine/ai/conventions/preempts.py:130-165`
**Issue:** Response logic incomplete
**Fix Applied:** Enhanced `_get_response_to_preempt` method:
- 2NT Ogust with 15+ HCP ✅
- Raise to 3-level with 11+ points and fit ✅
- Raise to 4-level with 17+ points and fit (2-level) or 15+ (3-level) ✅
- 3NT with 16+ HCP balanced, no fit ✅
- Pass otherwise ✅
**Note:** Ogust responses and slam exploration deferred to Phase 2
**Commit:** 7b8278f (2025-10-10)
**Tests:** 9/9 passing

---

### 13. ✅ **FIXED: Preempts: No 3-Level or 4-Level Preempts**
**File:** `engine/ai/conventions/preempts.py:23-80`
**Issue:** Only generated 2-level preempts
**Fix Applied:** Complete preempt ladder implemented:
- 2-level: 6-card suit, 6-10 HCP, strict quality (2 of top 3 honors) ✅
- 3-level: 7-card suit, 6-10 HCP, 2+ honors ✅
- 4-level: 8-card suit, 6-10 HCP, 2+ honors ✅
- Priority system: Longer suits bid first ✅
- SAYC restrictions for weak twos (no void, no singleton ace, no 4-card side major) ✅
**Impact:** Complete preempt bidding at all levels
**Commit:** 7b8278f (2025-10-10)
**Tests:** 9/9 passing

---

## 🟡 MODERATE ISSUES (Medium Priority - Suboptimal Bidding)

### 14. **Opening Bids: No Weak Two Preempts**
**File:** `engine/opening_bids.py:6-41`
**Issue:** No logic for weak two bids (2♦, 2♥, 2♠)
**Note:** This is handled by PreemptConvention module, but not integrated into opening_bids
**Impact:** Opening bids module incomplete, relies on preempt module being checked first
**Fix:** Either integrate preempt logic or document dependency clearly

---

### 15. **Opening Bids: No 3NT Gambling or 4-Level Openings**
**File:** `engine/opening_bids.py:11`
**Issue:** Line 11 has 3NT for 25-27 HCP balanced, but missing:
- 3NT Gambling (long solid minor, little outside)
- 4♥/4♠ preemptive openings (8-card suit)
- 4NT Blackwood opening (rare but exists)

**Impact:** Missing some rare but valid opening bids
**Fix:** Add gambling 3NT and 4-level preemptive openings (low priority)

---

### 16. **Responses: Missing Jump Shift Responses**
**File:** `engine/responses.py:113-149`
**Issue:** No logic for jump shift responses (e.g., 1♥ - 3♣)
**SAYC Standard:** Jump shift shows 17+ HCP, game-forcing, typically 5+ card suit
**Example:** 1♥ - 3♣ (not 2♣) shows very strong hand

**Impact:** Can't show strong hands with jump shifts
**Fix:** Add jump shift detection and logic (requires 17+ HCP, 5+ suit)

---

### 17. **Responses: Missing 2NT Response**
**File:** `engine/responses.py:113-149`
**Issue:** No logic for 2NT response to 1-level suit opening
**SAYC Standard:** 2NT response shows 11-12 HCP, balanced, no fit, forcing to game
**Example:** 1♠ - 2NT

**Impact:** With 11-12 HCP balanced, bids 1NT (showing only 6-9) or a suit
**Fix:** Add 2NT response logic before 1NT response check

---

### 18. **Responses: Missing Inverted Minors**
**File:** `engine/responses.py:91-128`
**Issue:** No support for inverted minor raises
**Inverted Minors:** 1♣ - 2♣ or 1♦ - 2♦ shows 10+ HCP, 5+ card fit, game-forcing (inverse of major raises)
**Note:** This is an optional convention in SAYC, but commonly played
**Impact:** Can't use inverted minor raises
**Fix:** Add inverted minor logic (optional, document if not implementing)

---

### 19. **Rebids: No Reverse Bid Logic**
**File:** `engine/rebids.py:32-97`
**Issue:** No specific handling of reverse bids
**Reverse Bid:** Opener bids higher-ranking suit at 2-level (e.g., 1♣ - 1♠ - 2♦)
**SAYC Standard:** Reverse shows 17+ HCP, forcing one round, shows 5-4 distribution minimum

**Current:** May bid reverses without checking if hand qualifies
**Impact:** May reverse with minimum hands or not reverse when appropriate
**Fix:** Add reverse detection and 17+ HCP requirement

---

### 20. **Rebids: Missing 2NT Rebid After 1-Level Response**
**File:** `engine/rebids.py:61-73`
**Issue:** After 1-level response (e.g., 1♣ - 1♥), no logic for opener to rebid 2NT
**SAYC Standard:** 2NT rebid shows 18-19 HCP, balanced
**Example:** 1♣ - 1♥ - 2NT (shows 18-19 HCP, balanced, too strong for 1NT opening)

**Current:** Line 73 bids 1NT with 12-14 HCP, but no 2NT with 18-19
**Impact:** Can't show 18-19 HCP balanced hands properly
**Fix:** Add 2NT rebid logic for 18-19 HCP before other rebids

---

### 21. **Rebids: Missing 3NT Rebid**
**File:** `engine/rebids.py:86-102`
**Issue:** With 19+ points, jumps to 3NT only as fallback (line 102)
**Problem:** Should check for balanced hand and appropriate range first
**SAYC Standard:** 3NT rebid shows 19-20 HCP, balanced

**Current:** Only bids 3NT as last resort without checking if hand is balanced
**Impact:** May bid 3NT with unbalanced hands
**Fix:** Check `hand.is_balanced` and HCP range before bidding 3NT

---

### 22. **Overcalls: Missing Jump Overcalls (Weak and Intermediate)**
**File:** `engine/overcalls.py:180-182`
**Issue:** Lines 180-182 explicitly skip 3-level overcalls
**Missing:**
- Weak jump overcall (e.g., 1♥ - 2♠): 6-10 HCP, 6-card suit, preemptive
- Intermediate jump overcall (e.g., 1♥ - 2♠): 11-14 HCP, 6-card suit (partnership dependent)

**SAYC Standard:** Weak jump overcalls are standard
**Impact:** Can't make weak jump overcalls
**Fix:** Add weak jump overcall logic (check for 6-card suit, 6-10 HCP)

---

### 23. **Overcalls: Missing Cuebid Overcall**
**File:** `engine/overcalls.py:59-77`
**Issue:** No logic for Michaels Cuebid (immediate cuebid of opponent's suit)
**Note:** This should be in michaels_cuebid.py, but that file is empty
**Example:** 1♥ - 2♥ (Michaels, showing spades + minor)

**Impact:** Can't show two-suited hands with cuebid
**Fix:** Implement michaels_cuebid.py module

---

### 24. **Advancer: Very Minimal Logic**
**File:** `engine/advancer_bids.py:7-37`
**Issue:** Only 2 actions: raise partner or cuebid
**Missing:**
- New suit bids (non-forcing)
- NT bids after partner's suit overcall
- Jump raises (preemptive vs invitational)
- Negative free bids
- Responsive doubles (after partner's takeout double)

**Impact:** Very limited advancer actions
**Fix:** Add comprehensive advancer bidding structure

---

### 25. **Advancer: Cuebid Always Game-Forcing**
**File:** `engine/advancer_bids.py:33-35`
**Issue:** Cuebid logic (lines 33-35) shows cuebid with 12+ HCP
**Problem:** This is correct, but no alternative for invitational hands (10-11 HCP)
**Missing:** With 10-11 HCP and fit, should make invitational raise, not cuebid

**Impact:** Over-aggressive cuebids
**Fix:** Add invitational raise option before cuebid

---

## 🟢 MINOR ISSUES (Low Priority - Edge Cases or Documentation)

### 26. **Opening Bids: Tie-Breaking for Equal Length Suits**
**File:** `engine/opening_bids.py:36-39`
**Issue:** Lines 36-39 open longer minor, but with equal minors always opens 1♣
**SAYC Guideline:** With 3-3 minors, open 1♣; with 4-4, depends on hand strength/shape
**Current:** Always opens 1♣ with equal minors (line 38-39)

**Impact:** Minor issue, current behavior is acceptable for 3-3
**Fix:** Add note about 4-4 minor considerations (optional)

---

### 27. **Overcalls: No Defense Against Preempts**
**File:** `engine/overcalls.py:28-47`
**Issue:** Overcall logic doesn't adjust for opponent's preempt
**Example:** After opponent opens 3♦, different requirements for 3♥ overcall
**Impact:** May overcall preempts with insufficient strength
**Fix:** Add preempt-specific overcall adjustments (low priority)

---

### 28. **Takeout Doubles: No Support Doubles**
**File:** `engine/ai/conventions/takeout_doubles.py`
**Issue:** No logic for support doubles (showing 3-card support after partner responds)
**Support Double:** Partner opens, we respond, RHO overcalls, opener doubles to show 3-card support
**Example:** 1♣ - (P) - 1♥ - (1♠) - X (shows 3-card heart support)

**Impact:** Can't show 3-card support with support double
**Fix:** Add support double logic (advanced convention, low priority)

---

### 29. **Negative Doubles: Missing Responsive Doubles**
**File:** `engine/ai/conventions/negative_doubles.py`
**Issue:** Negative doubles only handle immediate position, not responsive situations
**Responsive Double:** Partner makes takeout double, RHO raises, we double
**Example:** 1♥ - (X) - 2♥ - (X) = responsive double

**Impact:** Can't make responsive doubles
**Fix:** Add responsive double logic (low priority, advanced)

---
