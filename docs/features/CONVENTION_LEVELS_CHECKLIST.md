## ‚è≥ To Do (Integration & Testing)

### Backend Integration
- [ ] Add import to `server.py`
  ```python
  from engine.learning.learning_path_api import register_learning_endpoints
  ```

- [ ] Register endpoints in `server.py`
  ```python
  register_learning_endpoints(app)
  ```

- [ ] Initialize database
  ```bash
  cd backend
  python database/init_convention_data.py
  ```

- [ ] Test all API endpoints
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:5001/api/conventions/by-level
  curl http://localhost:5001/api/skill-tree
  curl http://localhost:5001/api/user/convention-progress?user_id=1
  ```

### Testing
- [ ] Verify database tables created
  ```bash
  sqlite3 backend/bridge.db ".tables"
  # Should show: conventions, convention_prerequisites,
  # user_convention_progress, convention_practice_history
  ```

- [ ] Verify convention data populated
  ```bash
  sqlite3 backend/bridge.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM conventions;"
  # Should return: 15
  ```

- [ ] Test prerequisite checking
  - [ ] Essential conventions unlock after Level 1
  - [ ] Intermediate unlocks after Essential mastered
  - [ ] Advanced unlocks after Intermediate mastered

- [ ] Test progress tracking
  - [ ] Practice records update attempts/accuracy
  - [ ] Status changes: locked ‚Üí unlocked ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí mastered
  - [ ] Mastery detected correctly (hands + accuracy)

- [ ] Test recommendation engine
  - [ ] Recommends by level priority (Essential > Inter > Adv)
  - [ ] Recommends by frequency (Very High > High > Med > Low)
  - [ ] Returns None when all mastered

## üìù Notes

### Design Decisions Made
1. **Hybrid approach**: Metadata registry + skill tree integration
2. **Three difficulty levels**: Essential, Intermediate, Advanced
3. **Sequential unlocking**: Must master level before next unlocks
4. **Mastery criteria**: Practice hands + accuracy threshold
5. **Recommendation priority**: Level > Frequency

### Known Limitations
1. No user authentication (assumes user_id parameter)
2. No spaced repetition for reviews (yet)
3. No adaptive difficulty within conventions
4. No social features (yet)

### Dependencies
- Backend: Python 3.x, Flask, SQLite
- Frontend: React, React Router
- Database: SQLite 3.x
- None: No external API dependencies
