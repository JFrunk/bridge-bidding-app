# Responder's Rebids - Complete Design Document

**Status:** Design Phase
**Priority:** HIGH - Critical for complete auction sequences
**Date:** 2025-10-12

---

## Overview

This document defines complete logic for responder's second (and subsequent) bids after:
1. Opener makes their opening bid
2. Responder makes initial response
3. Opener rebids
4. **Responder must now make intelligent rebid**

---

## Current State Analysis

### What Exists (responses.py:282-352)
- ‚úÖ 2‚ô£ auction continuations (game-forcing)
- ‚úÖ Basic point-based rebids (very generic)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No auction context awareness
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No suit preference logic
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No forcing vs non-forcing intelligence

### Critical Gaps
1. ‚ùå Preference bids (choosing between opener's suits)
2. ‚ùå New suit rebids (forcing vs non-forcing)
3. ‚ùå Jump rebids to show extras
4. ‚ùå Support for opener's rebid suit
5. ‚ùå NT rebids with stoppers
6. ‚ùå Competitive rebids after interference
7. ‚ùå Checkback sequences (New Minor Forcing, XYZ)

## SAYC Responder Rebid Rules

### Rule 1: Minimum Rebids (6-9 points)
**Philosophy:** Sign off, don't encourage game

| Auction Example | Rebid | Meaning |
|----------------|-------|---------|
| 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-1‚ô†-? | Pass | No fit, minimum |
| 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-1‚ô†-? | 2‚ô£ | Preference to clubs, 3+ clubs |
| 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-2‚ô£-? | Pass | Minimum, 5+ clubs accepted |
| 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-1NT-? | Pass | Minimum, balanced acceptable |
| 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-2‚ô¶-? | 2‚ô£ | Preference, probably longer clubs |

**Key Points:**
- Pass when comfortable with opener's rebid
- Give simple preference with 2-card support
- Rebid own 6+ card suit at 2-level
- Do NOT bid new suits (would be forcing)

### Rule 2: Invitational Rebids (10-12 points)
**Philosophy:** Invite game, but let opener decide

| Auction Example | Rebid | Meaning |
|----------------|-------|---------|
| 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-1‚ô†-? | 2NT | 10-12 HCP, balanced, stoppers |
| 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-1‚ô†-? | 3‚ô† | 10-12 pts, 3+ spades, invitational |
| 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-2‚ô£-? | 3‚ô£ | 10-12 pts, 3+ clubs, invitational |
| 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-1NT-? | 2NT | 10-12 HCP, balanced, invitational |
| 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-1‚ô†-? | 3‚ô• | 10-12 pts, 6+ hearts, invitational |

**Key Points:**
- Jump to 3-level to invite
- 2NT shows balanced with stoppers
- Jump in own suit shows 6+ cards
- Jump raise of opener's suit shows 3+ support

### Rule 3: Game-Forcing Rebids (13+ points)
**Philosophy:** Ensure game is reached

| Auction Example | Rebid | Meaning |
|----------------|-------|---------|
| 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-1‚ô†-? | 3NT | 13-15 HCP, balanced, stoppers |
| 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-1‚ô†-? | 4‚ô† | 13+ pts, 3+ spades, game |
| 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-1‚ô†-? | 4‚ô• | 13+ pts, 6+ hearts, game |
| 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-1‚ô†-? | 3‚ô£ | 13+ pts, 5+ clubs, forcing |
| 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-2‚ô¶-? | 2‚ô† | Fourth Suit Forcing (artificial) |

**Key Points:**
- Bid game directly when hand is clear
- New suit at 3-level is forcing
- Fourth suit is artificial game force
- 3NT with balanced 13-15 HCP

### Rule 4: Preference Bids
**When:** Opener shows two suits

**Logic:**
```
1‚ô£ - 1‚ô• - 1‚ô† - ?

If 2+ spades AND 2+ clubs:
  - Choose based on LENGTH (prefer longer suit)
  - If equal, prefer FIRST suit (clubs)

Strength determines LEVEL:
  - 6-9 pts: Simple preference (2‚ô£ or pass)
  - 10-12 pts: Jump preference (3‚ô£ or 3‚ô†)
  - 13+ pts: Game (4‚ô†, 3NT, or 5‚ô£)
```

**Examples:**
- 1‚ô¶-1‚ô†-2‚ô£-2‚ô¶ = Preference to diamonds, 6-9 pts, 3+ diamonds
- 1‚ô¶-1‚ô†-2‚ô£-3‚ô¶ = Invitational, 10-12 pts, 3+ diamonds
- 1‚ô•-1‚ô†-2‚ô£-2‚ô• = Preference to hearts, 6-9 pts, 2+ hearts

### Rule 5: Fourth Suit Forcing (FSF)
**When:** Responder bids the only unbid suit

**Requirements:**
- 12+ HCP (game-forcing)
- No natural bid available
- Asking opener to describe hand further

**Examples:**
- 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-1‚ô†-**2‚ô¶** = FSF (artificial, diamonds may not exist)
- 1‚ô¶-1‚ô†-2‚ô£-**2‚ô•** = FSF (artificial)

**Responses to FSF:**
- Bid 3-card support for responder's first suit
- Bid NT with stopper in FSF suit
- Rebid 6+ card suit
- Raise FSF suit with 4+ cards (rare, but natural)

### Rule 6: Rebidding Own Suit
**Shows:** 6+ card suit (sometimes 5 good cards)

| Strength | Bid | Example |
|----------|-----|---------|
| 6-9 pts | Simple rebid (2-level) | 1‚ô¶-1‚ô•-1NT-**2‚ô•** |
| 10-12 pts | Jump rebid (3-level) | 1‚ô¶-1‚ô•-1NT-**3‚ô•** |
| 13+ pts | Game rebid (4-level) | 1‚ô¶-1‚ô•-1NT-**4‚ô•** |

**Special Case:** After 1NT rebid, responder's 2-level rebid is to play

### Rule 7: Notrump Rebids
**Requirements:**
- Balanced hand
- Stoppers in unbid suits
- Appropriate point range

| Auction | Rebid | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|
| 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-1‚ô†-**1NT** | Illegal (already at 1NT level) |
| 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-1‚ô†-**2NT** | 10-12 HCP, balanced, stoppers |
| 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-1‚ô†-**3NT** | 13-15 HCP, balanced, stoppers |
| 1‚ô£-1‚ô•-2‚ô£-**2NT** | 10-12 HCP, balanced |

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Responder Rebid Module

**File:** `backend/engine/responder_rebids.py`

**Structure:**
```python
class ResponderRebidModule(ConventionModule):
    """
    Handles responder's second bid after:
    1. Partner opened
    2. We responded
    3. Partner rebid
    4. Our turn again
    """

    def evaluate(self, hand, features):
        # Detect we are responder on our second+ bid
        # Get auction context
        # Route to appropriate handler
        pass

    def _classify_opener_rebid(self, opening_bid, opener_rebid):
        """
        Determine what opener showed:
        - Same suit (1‚ô•-1‚ô†-2‚ô•)
        - Second suit (1‚ô£-1‚ô•-1‚ô†)
        - Notrump (1‚ô¶-1‚ô•-1NT)
        - Reverse (1‚ô¶-1‚ô†-2‚ô•)
        - Jump (1‚ô£-1‚ô•-3‚ô£)
        """
        pass

    def _get_preference_bid(self, hand, opener_suit1, opener_suit2):
        """Choose between opener's two suits"""
        pass

    def _get_support_bid(self, hand, opener_rebid_suit):
        """Raise opener's rebid suit"""
        pass

    def _get_own_suit_rebid(self, hand, my_first_suit):
        """Rebid own suit with 6+ cards"""
        pass

    def _get_nt_rebid(self, hand):
        """Bid notrump with balanced hand"""
        pass

    def _get_new_suit_bid(self, hand, auction_context):
        """Bid new suit (may be FSF)"""
        pass
```

### Phase 2: Auction Context Detection

**Key Information Needed:**
1. What did I bid first? (my_first_response)
2. What did opener rebid? (opener_rebid)
3. Was it same suit, new suit, or NT?
4. What's my point range?
5. What suits do I have length in?

**Helper Functions:**
```python
def _count_suits_bid(self, auction_history):
    """Count how many different suits shown"""

def _identify_unbid_suit(self, suits_bid):
    """Find the fourth suit (for FSF)"""

def _is_forcing_situation(self, auction_context):
    """Determine if we're in a forcing auction"""
```

### Phase 3: Point-Range Based Actions

**Framework:**
```python
# Minimum (6-9 points)
if 6 <= hand.total_points <= 9:
    return self._minimum_rebid(hand, auction_context)

# Invitational (10-12 points)
elif 10 <= hand.total_points <= 12:
    return self._invitational_rebid(hand, auction_context)

# Game Forcing (13+ points)
elif hand.total_points >= 13:
    return self._game_forcing_rebid(hand, auction_context)
```

### Phase 4: Integration Points

**Where to Hook In:**
1. ‚úÖ `responses.py:_get_responder_rebid()` - Already exists but needs rewrite
2. üÜï `responder_rebids.py` - New comprehensive module
3. üîÑ `bidding_engine.py` - Register new module with correct priority

**Priority Order:**
```python
# In decision_engine.py or bidding_engine.py
modules = [
    # ... opening bids, responses ...

    # Responder's second bid (before general response catch-all)
    ResponderRebidModule(),  # NEW - priority 40

    # Conventions that apply to responder rebids
    FourthSuitForcingConvention(),  # priority 35 (higher priority)

    # ... other conventions ...
]
```

## Test Scenarios

### Test Suite 1: Minimum Rebids (6-9 points)
```python
# Test 1: Simple preference
hand = "‚ô†AJ5 ‚ô•Q874 ‚ô¶K32 ‚ô£852"  # 9 HCP
auction = "1‚ô£ - 1‚ô• - 1‚ô† - ?"
expected = "2‚ô£"  # Preference to clubs (3 cards vs 3 spades)

# Test 2: Pass with fit
hand = "‚ô†K74 ‚ô•QJ862 ‚ô¶952 ‚ô£83"  # 7 HCP
auction = "1‚ô¶ - 1‚ô• - 2‚ô• - ?"
expected = "Pass"  # Minimum, happy with fit

# Test 3: Rebid own suit
hand = "‚ô†AJ9874 ‚ô•K5 ‚ô¶863 ‚ô£72"  # 9 HCP
auction = "1‚ô£ - 1‚ô† - 2‚ô£ - ?"
expected = "2‚ô†"  # 6-card suit, show length
```

### Test Suite 2: Invitational Rebids (10-12 points)
```python
# Test 4: Jump preference
hand = "‚ô†KQ5 ‚ô•AJ84 ‚ô¶K32 ‚ô£852"  # 12 HCP
auction = "1‚ô£ - 1‚ô• - 1‚ô† - ?"
expected = "3‚ô†"  # Invitational raise with 3 spades

# Test 5: 2NT invitational
hand = "‚ô†KJ5 ‚ô•AQ84 ‚ô¶Q32 ‚ô£J52"  # 11 HCP
auction = "1‚ô£ - 1‚ô• - 1‚ô† - ?"
expected = "2NT"  # Balanced, stoppers, invitational

# Test 6: Jump in own suit
hand = "‚ô†AQJ874 ‚ô•K5 ‚ô¶Q63 ‚ô£72"  # 12 HCP
auction = "1‚ô¶ - 1‚ô† - 2‚ô¶ - ?"
expected = "3‚ô†"  # Invitational with 6-card suit
```

### Test Suite 3: Game-Forcing Rebids (13+ points)
```python
# Test 7: Direct game
hand = "‚ô†KQ85 ‚ô•AJ84 ‚ô¶K32 ‚ô£A5"  # 15 HCP
auction = "1‚ô£ - 1‚ô• - 1‚ô† - ?"
expected = "4‚ô†"  # Game with 4 spades

# Test 8: 3NT
hand = "‚ô†KJ5 ‚ô•AQ84 ‚ô¶AQ3 ‚ô£J52"  # 14 HCP
auction = "1‚ô£ - 1‚ô• - 1‚ô† - ?"
expected = "3NT"  # Balanced, game values

# Test 9: Fourth Suit Forcing
hand = "‚ô†AQJ5 ‚ô•KQ84 ‚ô¶A32 ‚ô£75"  # 14 HCP
auction = "1‚ô£ - 1‚ô• - 1‚ô† - ?"
expected = "2‚ô¶"  # FSF - need more info from partner
```

### Test Suite 4: Complex Sequences
```python
# Test 10: After opener's reverse
hand = "‚ô†K74 ‚ô•QJ862 ‚ô¶K52 ‚ô£83"  # 9 HCP
auction = "1‚ô¶ - 1‚ô• - 2‚ô† - ?"  # Reverse (forcing)
expected = "2NT" or "3‚ô•"  # Must bid (forced), show weakness

# Test 11: After 1NT rebid
hand = "‚ô†K74 ‚ô•AQJ862 ‚ô¶52 ‚ô£83"  # 10 HCP
auction = "1‚ô¶ - 1‚ô• - 1NT - ?"
expected = "3‚ô•"  # Invitational with 6-card suit

# Test 12: After jump rebid
hand = "‚ô†K74 ‚ô•QJ86 ‚ô¶K52 ‚ô£983"  # 9 HCP
auction = "1‚ô¶ - 1‚ô• - 3‚ô¶ - ?"  # Invitational jump
expected = "4‚ô¶" or "3NT"  # Accept invitation with maximum
```
