## Game Overview

### Basic Structure
- **Players**: 4 players in 2 fixed partnerships
- **Partnerships**: North-South (N-S) vs East-West (E-W)
- **Deck**: Standard 52-card deck
- **Positions**: Players sit N, E, S, W around a table
- **Partners**: Sit opposite each other (N-S are partners, E-W are partners)

### Suit Ranking (Highest to Lowest)
1. **Spades (♠)** - Major suit
2. **Hearts (♥)** - Major suit
3. **Diamonds (♦)** - Minor suit
4. **Clubs (♣)** - Minor suit
5. **No Trump (NT)** - No suit is trump

### Card Ranking (Highest to Lowest)
A (Ace) > K (King) > Q (Queen) > J (Jack) > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7 > 6 > 5 > 4 > 3 > 2

### Game Objective
Win points by accurately bidding and then making (or defeating) contracts through trick-taking.

---

## Game Setup and Dealing

### The Deal
1. **Shuffle**: Dealer shuffles the deck thoroughly
2. **Deal**: Dealer deals all 52 cards clockwise, one at a time, face down
3. **Result**: Each player receives exactly 13 cards
4. **Dealer Rotation**: Dealer position rotates clockwise for each new hand

### Hand Organization
Players organize their hands by suit, typically:
- Suits arranged from highest to lowest (♠ ♥ ♦ ♣) or by color
- Cards within each suit ranked from highest to lowest

---

## Phase 1: The Auction (Bidding)

### Purpose
The auction determines:
1. **The Contract**: How many tricks the declaring side commits to win
2. **Trump Suit**: Which suit (if any) will be trump
3. **Declarer**: Who will play the hand for their partnership
4. **Dummy**: Declarer's partner (whose cards will be exposed)

### Auction Mechanics

#### Starting the Auction
- Dealer makes the first call
- Bidding proceeds clockwise around the table

#### Legal Calls
Players may make one of four calls:

1. **BID**: Commit to win a specific number of tricks with a trump suit or NT
   - Format: Level (1-7) + Denomination (♣ ♦ ♥ ♠ NT)
   - Example: "2♥" means "I contract to win 8 tricks with Hearts as trump"
   - **Trick Level Math**: Bid level + 6 = total tricks needed
     - 1-level = 7 tricks (6+1)
     - 2-level = 8 tricks (6+2)
     - 3-level = 9 tricks (6+3)
     - 4-level = 10 tricks (6+4)
     - 5-level = 11 tricks (6+5)
     - 6-level = 12 tricks (6+6) - Small Slam
     - 7-level = 13 tricks (6+7) - Grand Slam

2. **PASS**: Decline to bid at this turn (not permanent - can bid later)

3. **DOUBLE (X)**:
   - Can only double an opponent's bid
   - Increases scoring (both for making and defeating the contract)
   - Suggests ability to defeat opponent's contract

4. **REDOUBLE (XX)**:
   - Can only redouble a doubled contract by your side
   - Further increases scoring
   - Expresses confidence in making the contract

#### Bidding Rules
- Each bid must be higher than the previous bid
- "Higher" means:
  - Same level, higher-ranking suit/denomination, OR
  - Higher level (any suit/denomination)

**Examples**:
- After 1♣, valid bids: 1♦, 1♥, 1♠, 1NT, 2♣, 2♦, etc.
- After 1NT, valid bids: 2♣, 2♦, 2♥, 2♠, 2NT, 3♣, etc.
- After 3♥, valid bids: 3♠, 3NT, 4♣, 4♦, 4♥, 4♠, 4NT, etc.

#### End of Auction
- Auction ends when three consecutive players PASS
- The last bid made becomes the **contract**
- If all four players pass initially (no bids made), the hand is "passed out" and redealt

#### Determining Declarer and Dummy
- **Declarer**: The player from the contracting side who FIRST bid the denomination of the final contract
- **Dummy**: Declarer's partner
- **Defenders**: The opposing partnership

**Example**:
```
North   East    South   West
1♥      Pass    2♥      Pass
4♥      Pass    Pass    Pass

Contract: 4♥
Declarer: North (first to bid Hearts)
Dummy: South
Defenders: East and West
```

---

## Phase 2: Play of the Hand

### Transition from Bidding to Play

1. **Auction ends** (three consecutive passes)
2. **Opening Leader** is determined (defender to left of declarer)
3. **Opening Lead** is made (first card played)
4. **Dummy exposed** (after opening lead, dummy's cards placed face-up)

### The Opening Lead

- **Opening Leader**: Always the defender sitting to the DECLARER'S LEFT
- Leader plays any card from their hand face-up on the table
- This card starts the first trick

### Dummy Exposure Rules

**CRITICAL TIMING**: Dummy's cards are exposed AFTER the opening lead, NOT before.

**Procedure**:
1. Opening leader plays first card
2. Dummy then places all 13 cards face-up on the table
3. Cards arranged in four columns by suit, typically:
   - Suits in order (♠ ♥ ♦ ♣ or by trump/non-trump)
   - Cards in each suit ranked highest to lowest
4. Dummy may not participate in play decisions

### Play Mechanics

#### Trick-Taking Process
1. **Lead**: One player leads a card (plays first)
2. **Follow**: Other three players play one card each in clockwise order
3. **Must Follow Suit**: Players MUST play a card of the led suit if they have one
4. **Discarding/Trumping**: If unable to follow suit, player may:
   - Discard any card from another suit, OR
   - Play a trump card (if a trump suit was established)
5. **Winning the Trick**: The trick is won by:
   - **Highest trump card** (if any trump was played), OR
   - **Highest card of the led suit** (if no trump was played)
6. **Next Lead**: Winner of the trick leads the next trick

#### Declarer and Dummy

**DECLARER**:
- Controls BOTH hands (their own and dummy's)
- Calls which card to play from dummy
- Plays their own cards themselves
- Makes ALL play decisions for the partnership

**DUMMY**:
- Lays cards face-up after opening lead
- Does NOT make play decisions
- May NOT suggest plays or comment
- May warn declarer about irregularities (e.g., revoke)
- Physically places cards from dummy when declarer calls for them (or declarer may do this)

**DEFENDERS**:
- Each plays their own hand independently
- Cannot see partner's cards
- Must follow all trick-taking rules

#### Trump Suit Privileges

When a trump suit is established (any suit contract, not NT):

- **Trump Power**: Any trump card beats any non-trump card
- **Trumping/Ruffing**: Playing a trump when unable to follow suit
- **Overtrumping**: Playing a higher trump when a lower trump has been played
- **Cannot trump if able to follow suit**: Must follow suit when possible

**Example**:
```
Trump suit: Hearts (♥)
Lead: ♠K

Play:     North plays ♠A (highest spade)
          East plays ♥2 (trumps - cannot follow suit)
          South plays ♠5 (follows suit)

Winner: East (trump beats non-trump, even the 2♥ beats A♠)
```

### End of Play

- All 13 tricks are played
- Each side counts tricks won
- Proceed to Scoring phase

---

## Phase 3: Scoring

### Scoring Overview

Bridge scoring varies between:
- **Rubber Bridge**: Cumulative scoring across multiple deals
- **Duplicate Bridge**: Each deal scored independently
- **Chicago Bridge**: Four-deal game with rotation

**This guide focuses on Duplicate Bridge scoring** (most common for computer bridge).

### Vulnerability

**Vulnerability** affects scoring:
- **Vulnerable (Vul)**: Higher bonuses for making contracts, higher penalties for failing
- **Not Vulnerable (Non-vul)**: Lower bonuses and penalties

In duplicate bridge, vulnerability is predetermined by board number:
- **Both Vul**: Boards 2, 5, 12, 15
- **N-S Vul**: Boards 3, 6, 9, 16
- **E-W Vul**: Boards 4, 7, 10, 13
- **Neither Vul**: Boards 1, 8, 11, 14
- (Pattern repeats every 16 boards)

### Contract Points (Below the Line)

Points for tricks BID and MADE:

| Level | ♣ (per trick) | ♦ (per trick) | ♥ (per trick) | ♠ (per trick) | NT (1st/subsequent) |
|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Points| 20            | 20            | 30            | 30            | 40/30               |

**Examples**:
- **3NT made**: 40 + 30 + 30 = 100 points
- **4♥ made**: 30 × 4 = 120 points
- **5♣ made**: 20 × 5 = 100 points
- **2♠ made**: 30 × 2 = 60 points

### Game and Part-Score

**GAME**: A contract worth 100+ points
- **3NT** = 100 points (GAME)
- **4♥ or 4♠** = 120 points (GAME)
- **5♣ or 5♦** = 100 points (GAME)

**PART-SCORE**: A contract worth less than 100 points
- **1NT** = 40 points (part-score)
- **2♥** = 60 points (part-score)
- **3♣** = 60 points (part-score)

### Bonuses (Above the Line)

#### Making Contract Bonuses (Duplicate)

| Contract Type | Not Vulnerable | Vulnerable |
|---------------|----------------|------------|
| Part-score    | +50            | +50        |
| Game          | +300           | +500       |

#### Slam Bonuses

| Slam Type      | Not Vulnerable | Vulnerable |
|----------------|----------------|------------|
| Small Slam (12 tricks) | +500   | +750       |
| Grand Slam (13 tricks) | +1000  | +1500      |

**Note**: Slam bonuses are IN ADDITION to game bonus.

**Example**:
- **6NT made, vulnerable**:
  - Contract points: 40 + (30 × 5) = 190
  - Game bonus: 500
  - Small slam bonus: 750
  - **Total: 1440 points**

#### Overtricks (Undoubled)

Tricks made BEYOND the contract:

| Trump/NT | Points per Overtrick |
|----------|---------------------|
| ♣ or ♦  | 20                  |
| ♥ or ♠  | 30                  |
| NT       | 30                  |

**Example**:
- Contract: 3NT (need 9 tricks)
- Made: 10 tricks (1 overtrick)
- Score: 100 (contract) + 30 (overtrick) + 300 (game bonus) = **430 points**

### Doubled and Redoubled Contracts

#### Made Doubled/Redoubled Contract

**Additional bonuses**:
- Doubled: +50 "insult bonus"
- Redoubled: +100 "insult bonus"

**Overtricks** (Doubled):

| Vulnerability | Points per Overtrick |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Not Vulnerable| 100                 |
| Vulnerable    | 200                 |

**Overtricks** (Redoubled): Double the doubled values (200/400)

**Example**:
- Contract: 2♥ Doubled, Not Vulnerable
- Made 9 tricks (1 overtrick)
- Score:
  - Contract points: 30 × 2 × 2 (doubled) = 120 (now a game!)
  - Game bonus: 300
  - Insult bonus: 50
  - Overtrick: 100
  - **Total: 570 points**

### Undertricks (Penalties)

When declarer FAILS to make the contract:

#### Undoubled Undertricks

| Vulnerability | Per Undertrick |
|---------------|---------------|
| Not Vulnerable| -50           |
| Vulnerable    | -100          |

**Example**:
- Contract: 3NT (need 9 tricks)
- Made: 7 tricks (down 2)
- Vulnerable
- Penalty: -100 × 2 = **-200 points**

#### Doubled Undertricks

| Undertricks | Not Vulnerable | Vulnerable |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| First       | -100           | -200       |
| Second      | -200           | -300       |
| Third       | -200           | -300       |
| Fourth +    | -300 each      | -300 each  |

**Example**:
- Contract: 4♠ Doubled
- Made: 8 tricks (down 2)
- Not Vulnerable
- Penalty: -100 (1st) + -200 (2nd) = **-300 points**

#### Redoubled Undertricks
Double all doubled penalty values (e.g., -200, -400, -400, -600...)

### Responses to Opening Bids

#### Responses to 1NT (15-17 HCP)

**Basic Responses**:

| Response | Requirements | Meaning |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Pass** | 0-7 HCP | No game possible |
| **2♣** | 8+ HCP | **Stayman** - asks for 4-card major |

- Opener rebids:
  - 2♦ = no 4-card major
  - 2♥ = 4-card heart suit
  - 2♠ = 4-card spade suit (may also have 4 hearts)

**Jacoby Transfers**:
- 2♦ response = transfer to hearts (opener must bid 2♥)
- 2♥ response = transfer to spades (opener must bid 2♠)
- Responder then passes (weak) or continues (invitational/game)

#### Responses to One of a Major (1♥ or 1♠)

**With Support** (3+ cards in partner's major):

| Response | Requirements | Meaning |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **2♥/♠** | 6-10 HCP, 3+ card support | Minimum raise |
| **3♥/♠** | 10-12 HCP, 4+ card support | Limit raise |

**Without Support**:

| Response | Requirements | Meaning |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **1♠** (over 1♥) | 6+ HCP, 4+ spades | New suit, forcing one round |
| **1NT** | 6-10 HCP, balanced | Minimum, no fit, forcing |
| **2♣/♦** | 11+ HCP, 4+ card suit | New suit at 2-level, forcing |
| **2NT** | 11-12 HCP, balanced | Invitational, no major fit |
| **3NT** | 13-15 HCP, balanced | Game, no major fit |

**Forcing vs Non-Forcing**:
- **One-level new suit** = Forcing one round
- **Two-level new suit** = Forcing one round (11+ HCP required)
- **1NT response** = Forcing one round
- **Jump to 2NT/3NT** = Not forcing (invitational/game)
- **Jump raises** = Not forcing (3♥/♠ invites game, 4♥/♠ ends auction)

#### Responses to One of a Minor (1♣ or 1♦)

**Priorities** (with 6+ HCP):
1. Bid a 4-card major at the one-level if possible
2. Bid 1NT (6-10 HCP) with no major
3. Raise minor with 5-card support and no major
4. Bid new suit at two-level (10+ HCP)

### Opener's Rebids

After opening and hearing responder's first bid, opener rebids to further describe their hand.

#### After Opening 1 of a Suit

**Hand Strength Categories**:
- **Minimum**: 13-15 HCP (open, then make minimum rebid)
- **Medium**: 16-18 HCP (open, then make invitational rebid)
- **Maximum**: 19-21 HCP (open, then make forcing rebid)

**Common Rebids**:

| Rebid | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Raise responder's suit** | Support (3+ cards) and values |
| **Rebid own suit** | 6+ card suit |
| **Bid new suit (lower)** | 4+ card suit, does not show extra values |
| **Bid new suit (reverse)** | 4+ card suit, 17+ HCP (forcing) |
| **Jump rebid** | 6+ card suit, 16-18 HCP, invitational |
| **Jump to game** | Strong hand, ends auction |
| **1NT** | 12-14 HCP, balanced, no better bid |
| **2NT** | 18-19 HCP, balanced |
| **3NT** | Good hand, likely based on long suit |

**Reverse Bidding**:
A "reverse" shows 17+ HCP and is forcing:
```
Opener  Responder
1♦      1♠
2♥      (This is a reverse - bidding higher suit at 2-level)
```

### Competitive Bidding

#### Takeout Doubles

**Takeout Double Requirements**:
- Used after opponent opens
- Shows:
  - Opening values (13+ HCP), OR
  - Support for unbid suits (especially majors)
  - Shortage in opponent's suit

**When to Double**:
```
Opponent  You     Meaning
1♥        Dbl     I have support for spades, diamonds, clubs
1♠        Dbl     I have support for hearts, diamonds, clubs
```

**Responding to Partner's Takeout Double**:
- **Forced to bid** (cannot pass except with strong hand in opponent's suit)
- Bid your longest suit
- Strength shown by level:
  - Minimum suit = 0-8 HCP
  - Jump = 9-11 HCP (invitational)
  - Jump to game = 12+ HCP

#### Negative Doubles

**Negative Double** (by responder after partner opens and opponent overcalls):

Shows:
- 6+ HCP
- Interest in unbid suits (especially majors)
- Denies ability to bid naturally

**Example**:
```
Partner  Opp    You
1♣       1♠     Dbl     (Shows hearts, some values, cannot bid 2♥)
```

**SAYC**: Negative doubles through 2♠

#### Overcalls

**Simple Overcall** (bidding after opponent opens):

Requirements:
- 8-16 HCP
- Good 5-card suit (6-card suit safer at 2-level)
- Suit quality important

**Examples**:
```
Opp    You
1♣     1♥      (8-16 HCP, good 5+ hearts)
1♥     2♦      (10-16 HCP, good 6+ diamonds)
```

**Jump Overcall** (weak):
- 6-11 HCP
- Good 6-card suit
- Preemptive

```
Opp    You

## Transitions Between Phases

### From Setup to Bidding
1. Cards are dealt (13 to each player)
2. Players sort and examine their hands
3. Players evaluate hand strength (HCP + distribution)
4. Dealer makes first call (bid or pass)
5. **AUCTION BEGINS**

### From Bidding to Play
1. Three consecutive passes occur
2. Final bid becomes the CONTRACT
3. **Declarer** identified (first to bid contract strain)
4. **Dummy** identified (declarer's partner)
5. **Opening Leader** identified (defender to left of declarer)
6. Opening leader selects and plays first card face-up
7. **AFTER OPENING LEAD**: Dummy spreads hand face-up on table
8. **PLAY BEGINS**

### During Play
1. Each trick: 4 cards played, one from each hand
2. Winner of trick leads next trick
3. Declarer controls both hands (own and dummy)
4. Play continues until all 13 tricks are played

### From Play to Scoring
1. All 13 tricks played
2. Count tricks won by each side
3. Determine if contract was made:
   - Made: Declaring side won contracted number of tricks (or more)
   - Defeated: Declaring side won fewer than contracted tricks
4. Calculate score based on:
   - Contract level and denomination
   - Vulnerability
   - Tricks made vs. tricks bid
   - Doubled/redoubled status
5. **HAND COMPLETE** - record score and deal next hand

### Starting Next Hand
1. Rotate dealer clockwise
2. Shuffle and deal new hand
3. Begin new auction
4. Process continues

## Special Rules and Conventions

### Irregularities and Penalties

#### Revoke (Failure to Follow Suit)
- **Revoke**: Playing a different suit when able to follow suit
- **Penalty**: If established (trick completed), transfer tricks
- **Correction**: If caught immediately, card may be corrected

#### Lead Out of Turn
- **Penalty**: Varies by when occurred
- **Opening lead out of turn**: Defender may accept or reject lead

#### Insufficient Bid
- **Insufficient bid**: Bid not higher than previous bid
- **Correction**: Must correct to legal bid or pass
- **Penalty**: Partner may be required to pass

#### Exposed Cards
- **Defender**: Card exposed accidentally becomes a penalty card (must be played at first legal opportunity)
- **Declarer/Dummy**: No penalty (dummy's cards are already exposed)

### Alerts and Explanations

In tournament play:
- **Alert**: Notify opponents when partner makes conventional or unexpected bid
- **Explanation**: Provide clear explanation when asked
- **Self-alerts**: Do not explain own bids until after auction

### Claims
- **Declarer** may claim remaining tricks by showing hand
- **Defenders** may accept or dispute claim
- If disputed, play continues

### Tempo and Timing
- **Hesitation**: Avoid giving information through timing
- **Break in tempo**: If partner hesitates, ethical player should not take advantage
- **Slow pass**: Particularly informative and unethical if abused

### Ethics
- **Full disclosure**: Must explain all partnership agreements
- **No unauthorized information**: Cannot use information from partner's tempo, facial expressions, etc.
- **Active ethics**: Volunteer information about possible irregularities
- **Zero tolerance**: Cheating and unethical behavior prohibited

**Defeating Contract**:
- Undertrick penalties only (awarded to defenders)

**Remember**:
- Vulnerability increases both bonuses (for making) and penalties (for failing)
- Doubles and redoubles multiply scoring dramatically
- Game = 100 contract points (3NT, 4M, 5m)
