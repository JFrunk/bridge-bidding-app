# How to Check If AI Loop is Running

## Visual Indicator (ADDED)

I've added a **colored indicator** in the top-right corner of the screen that shows the AI loop status:

### What You'll See:

**üü¢ Green Box: "AI Loop: RUNNING ‚ñ∂Ô∏è"**
- AI is actively playing
- Loop is processing
- Cards should be playing automatically

**üî¥ Red Box: "AI Loop: STOPPED ‚è∏Ô∏è"**
- AI is waiting
- Either it's your turn OR
- Loop is stuck/not continuing

## How to Use This Indicator

### Scenario 1: AI Loop STOPPED (Red) - Normal
**When it's your turn:**
- ‚úÖ Red box shows "STOPPED"
- ‚úÖ Your cards should be clickable (pointer cursor)
- ‚úÖ This is CORRECT behavior

**What to do:** Play your card, then box should turn green.

### Scenario 2: AI Loop STOPPED (Red) - Problem
**When it's NOT your turn:**
- ‚ùå Red box shows "STOPPED"
- ‚ùå AI should be playing but isn't
- ‚ùå This is the BUG

**What to check:**
1. Look at the position labels - whose turn is it?
2. If it says "North (Dummy)" and you're declarer ‚Üí Should be your turn (red is OK)
3. If it says "East" or "West" and they're AI ‚Üí Red is WRONG, loop should be running

### Scenario 3: AI Loop RUNNING (Green)
**Normal behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Green box shows "RUNNING"
- ‚úÖ AI is thinking/playing
- ‚úÖ Wait for AI to complete

**What happens:**
- AI plays a card (1 second delay)
- State updates
- If more AI turns ‚Üí stays green
- If your turn ‚Üí turns red and stops

## How to Open Browser Console

### On Mac:
1. **Option 1:** Press `Cmd + Option + I`
2. **Option 2:** Press `Cmd + Option + J`
3. **Option 3:** Right-click anywhere ‚Üí "Inspect" ‚Üí Click "Console" tab

### On Windows/Linux:
1. **Option 1:** Press `F12`
2. **Option 2:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + I`
3. **Option 3:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + J`

## What to Look For in Console

Once console is open, you'll see logs like:

### Good (Working):
```
üîÑ AI play loop triggered: { gamePhase: "playing", isPlayingCard: true }
üé¨ AI play loop RUNNING...
üéÆ Play State: { next_to_play: "N", dummy: "N", ... }
ü§î Turn check: { nextPlayer: "N", userIsDeclarer: true, ... }
‚è∏Ô∏è Stopping - User is declarer, dummy's turn
```

### Problem (Loop Stuck):
```
üîÑ AI play loop triggered: { gamePhase: "playing", isPlayingCard: false }
‚è≠Ô∏è AI play loop skipped: { gamePhase: "playing", isPlayingCard: false }
```

This means `isPlayingCard` is `false` when it should be `true`.

## Finding isPlayingCard Value

### Method 1: Visual Indicator (Easiest)
Just look at the **top-right corner** of the screen:
- üü¢ Green = `isPlayingCard: true`
- üî¥ Red = `isPlayingCard: false`

### Method 2: Console Log
Look for this line in console:
```
üéØ PlayTable render: {
  next_to_play: "N",
  isPlayingCard: false,    ‚Üê HERE IT IS!
  ...
}
```

### Method 3: Manual Check (Advanced)
In browser console, type:
```javascript
// This won't work because React state isn't globally accessible
// Use Method 1 or 2 instead
```

## Quick Troubleshooting

### Problem: Red "STOPPED" when AI should play

**Step 1:** Check whose turn it is
- Look at position labels
- Which one has the arrow ‚¨ÖÔ∏è?

**Step 2:** Identify role
- Are you declarer? (contract says "by S")
- Is it dummy's turn? (label says "Dummy")

**Step 3:** Determine if it's correct to stop
- **Your turn (not dummy):** Red is CORRECT
- **Dummy's turn & you're declarer:** Red is CORRECT
- **AI's turn (not dummy):** Red is WRONG

### Problem: Cards show "no-go" sign (üö´)

**This means cards are disabled.**

**Check:**
1. **Visual indicator** - Is it red or green?
2. **isDummyTurn in console** - Should be `true` when dummy's turn and you're declarer

**Console log shows:**
```
isDummyTurn: false    ‚Üê Cards disabled
isDummyTurn_calculation: {
  next_is_dummy: true,
  not_playing: false,   ‚Üê isPlayingCard is TRUE (should be FALSE!)
  user_is_declarer: true,
  result: false
}
```

**If `not_playing: false`** (meaning isPlayingCard is TRUE), that's the problem!

## What the Colors Mean

| Visual | isPlayingCard | When This is Correct |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| üü¢ Green RUNNING | true | AI is playing |
| üî¥ Red STOPPED | false | It's your turn to play |

| Visual | isPlayingCard | When This is WRONG |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| üî¥ Red STOPPED | false | AI should be playing but isn't |
| üü¢ Green RUNNING | true | Your turn but cards disabled |

## Current Issue Diagnosis

**Symptom:** "North's turn to play (dummy) but cards are inactive with red no-go sign"

**Analysis:**
- North is dummy
- You are declarer (South)
- It's North's turn
- **You should be able to play North's cards**

**Check:**
1. **Visual indicator:** Should be üî¥ RED (stopped, waiting for you)
2. **North's cards:** Should have pointer cursor (clickable)
3. **Console isDummyTurn:** Should be `true`

**If:**
- ‚úÖ Indicator is RED
- ‚ùå Cards show no-go sign
- ‚ùå isDummyTurn is `false`

**Then:** Problem is `isPlayingCard` is `true` when it should be `false`.

## Taking a Screenshot

To share with me:
1. **Show both:**
   - Top-right indicator (green/red box)
   - The cards with the no-go cursor
2. **Open console** (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
3. **Take screenshot** showing console logs
4. **Share:** I can see exactly what's happening

## Next Steps

1. **Refresh browser** (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Play until it's North's (dummy) turn**
3. **Look at top-right corner:**
   - If GREEN ‚Üí Wrong, should be RED
   - If RED ‚Üí Check isDummyTurn in console
4. **Report:**
   - What color is the indicator?
   - What does console say for `isPlayingCard`?
   - What does console say for `isDummyTurn`?

---

**The visual indicator makes it easy!** Just look at top-right:
- Green = AI playing
- Red = Waiting for you

If it's red when AI should play, or green when you should play, that's the bug!
