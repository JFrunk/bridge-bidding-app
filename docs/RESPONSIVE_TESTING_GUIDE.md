## Responsive Behavior Tests

### Font Scaling

Test that text scales appropriately:

| Element | Mobile (375px) | Desktop (1280px) |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| Body text | 14px | 16px |
| Headings | 20px | 24-28px |
| Button text | 14px | 16px |
| Labels | 12px | 14px |

### Touch Targets

Test that all interactive elements meet minimum sizes:

| Element | Mobile Minimum | Desktop |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Buttons | 36×36px | 48×40px |
| Links | 44px tap area | Normal |
| Input fields | 44px height | Normal |
| Checkboxes | 36×36px | Normal |

### Spacing

Verify spacing scales:

| Type | Mobile | Desktop |
|------|--------|---------|
| Component gaps | 4-8px | 8-16px |
| Padding | 12-16px | 16-24px |
| Margins | 8-12px | 16-20px |

## Common Issues to Check

### Horizontal Scroll (Most Common)
- [ ] Open app on 375px width
- [ ] Scroll through entire page
- [ ] No horizontal scrollbar appears
- [ ] All content fits within viewport

### Tap Targets Too Small
- [ ] All buttons at least 36×36px on mobile
- [ ] Can tap without zooming
- [ ] No accidental taps on adjacent elements

### Text Unreadable
- [ ] All text at least 14px on mobile
- [ ] Sufficient contrast (4.5:1 for body text)
- [ ] Line height adequate (1.5 minimum)

### Layout Breaks
- [ ] Grid doesn't collapse incorrectly
- [ ] Flex items don't overflow
- [ ] Images scale proportionally
- [ ] Fixed positioning doesn't cover content

## Testing Workflow

### Quick Smoke Test (5 minutes)
1. Open app at 375px width
2. Navigate through: Login → Bidding → Play → Dashboard
3. Verify no horizontal scroll
4. Verify all buttons tappable

### Full Responsive Test (15 minutes)
1. Test all components at 375px, 768px, 1280px
2. Complete all checklists above
3. Test both portrait and landscape on tablet
4. Verify interactions work on all sizes

### Regression Test (After Changes)
1. Test only the component you changed
2. Quick check at 375px, 768px
3. Verify no unintended side effects

## Automated Testing (Future)

Consider adding Playwright tests:

```javascript
// Example: Test BiddingBox responsive behavior
test('BiddingBox fits on mobile', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });
  await page.goto('/');

  const biddingBox = page.locator('.bidding-box');
  const boundingBox = await biddingBox.boundingBox();

  expect(boundingBox.width).toBeLessThan(375); // No overflow
});
```

---

## Reporting Issues

When you find a responsive issue:

### Issue Template
```markdown
**Component:** [BiddingBox / PlayTable / etc.]
**Viewport:** [375px / 768px / 1280px]
**Browser:** [Chrome / Safari / Firefox]
**Issue:** [Describe what's wrong]
**Screenshot:** [Attach if possible]
**Expected:** [What should happen]
**Actual:** [What actually happens]
```

### Example Report
```markdown
**Component:** Learning Dashboard
**Viewport:** 375px
**Browser:** Chrome
**Issue:** Stats bar overflows horizontally
**Expected:** Stats should stack vertically
**Actual:** Stats try to fit in one row, causing horizontal scroll
```

---

## Success Criteria

Your responsive implementation passes if:

✅ **No horizontal scroll** at any viewport 375px-1920px
✅ **All tap targets** meet 36px minimum on mobile
✅ **All text readable** at 14px+ on mobile
✅ **Interactions work** on all screen sizes
✅ **Layout makes sense** at all breakpoints
✅ **Performance good** (no lag when resizing)

## Real Device Testing

After DevTools testing, test on real devices:

### High Priority
- [ ] Your own phone (whatever you have)
- [ ] iPad if available
- [ ] Ask friend/family to test on their phone

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Android phone (different from iPhone)
- [ ] Older device (iPhone 8, etc.)
- [ ] Different browser (Safari vs Chrome)

### Low Priority
- [ ] Foldable devices
- [ ] Very small screens (<375px)
- [ ] Very large screens (>1920px)

## Tips for Efficient Testing

1. **Use browser presets:** DevTools has iPhone SE, iPad, etc. presets
2. **Test extremes first:** 375px and 1280px cover most issues
3. **Don't test every size:** Focus on breakpoints (640px, 768px, 1024px)
4. **Test interactions:** Don't just look, tap/click everything
5. **Check landscape too:** Tablets often used in landscape
6. **Clear cache:** Ensure you're seeing latest CSS
7. **Use real device when possible:** Simulators aren't perfect

## Reference

**Tailwind Breakpoints:**
- `sm:` = 640px
- `md:` = 768px
- `lg:` = 1024px
- `xl:` = 1280px
- `2xl:` = 1536px

**CSS Media Queries:**
- `@media (max-width: 480px)` - Small phones
- `@media (max-width: 768px)` - Tablets
- `@media (max-width: 900px)` - Small desktops

**Component Files:**
- BiddingBox: `frontend/src/components/bridge/BiddingBox.jsx`
- PlayTable: `frontend/src/PlayComponents.js` + CSS
- Dashboard: `frontend/src/components/learning/LearningDashboard.js` + CSS
- Auth: `frontend/src/components/auth/SimpleLogin.jsx` + CSS
