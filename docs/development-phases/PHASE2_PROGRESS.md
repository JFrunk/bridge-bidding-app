# Phase 2 Implementation Progress

**Started:** October 11, 2025
**Status:** In Progress - Foundation Complete (30% done)
**Next Session:** Implement MinimaxPlayAI core

---

## ✅ Completed (Session 1 - ~2 hours)

### 1. Directory Structure ✅
Created new organized module structure:
```
backend/engine/play/
├── __init__.py
├── ai/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── base_ai.py          ✅ DONE
│   ├── simple_ai.py        ✅ DONE
│   └── evaluation.py       ✅ DONE

backend/tests/play/         ✅ Created (empty)
backend/benchmarks/         ✅ Created (empty)
```

### 2. Base AI Interface ✅
**File:** `backend/engine/play/ai/base_ai.py`

Created abstract base class that all AI implementations must follow:
- `choose_card()` - Main method for card selection
- `get_name()` - Human-readable AI name
- `get_difficulty()` - Difficulty level (beginner/intermediate/advanced/expert)
- `get_explanation()` - Optional explanation (for educational purposes)
- `get_statistics()` - Optional performance metrics

**Benefits:**
- Type safety and consistent interface
- Easy to swap AI implementations
- Enables A/B testing and comparisons
- Future-proof for Phase 3 and beyond

### 3. SimplePlayAI Reorganization ✅
**File:** `backend/engine/play/ai/simple_ai.py`

Moved Phase 1 AI to new structure:
- Extends `BasePlayAI` abstract class
- All functionality preserved
- Added proper interface methods
- Better documentation

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Old import path still works: `from engine.simple_play_ai import SimplePlayAI`
- Shows deprecation warning
- Redirects to new location
- Zero breaking changes ✅

### 4. Position Evaluator ✅
**File:** `backend/engine/play/ai/evaluation.py`

Implemented evaluation function with two components:

**Component 1: Tricks Won (Weight 1.0)**
- Definitive - counts tricks already taken
- Simple subtraction: my_tricks - opponent_tricks

**Component 2: Sure Winners (Weight 0.6)**
- Counts high cards that must win
- Uses top-sequential heuristic (A, AK, AKQ, etc.)
- Conservative estimate (0.5 per sure winner)
- Evaluates across partnership (both hands)

**Testing:**
- Self-test passes ✅
- Correctly evaluates strong position: +3.6 for favorable side
- Components properly weighted
- Explanation function works

**Example output:**
```
Position evaluation for S: +3.6
├─ Sure Winners: +3.6 (raw: 6.0, weight: 0.6)
└─ Total: +3.6
```

## 📊 What We Have Now

### Working Components
1. ✅ **Modular architecture** - Clean separation of concerns
2. ✅ **Base interface** - All AIs follow same contract
3. ✅ **Phase 1 AI** - Reorganized and improved
4. ✅ **Evaluation function** - Basic but functional

## 🔄 Next Steps (Session 2)

### Priority 1: Core Minimax Implementation
**File to create:** `backend/engine/play/ai/minimax_ai.py`

**What needs to be done:**
1. Create `MinimaxPlayAI` class extending `BasePlayAI`
2. Implement minimax search with alpha-beta pruning
3. Start with depth 2-3 (configurable)
4. Use `PositionEvaluator` for leaf node scoring
5. Implement `_simulate_play()` helper (deep copy state)
6. Add node counting for performance metrics

**Estimated time:** 2-3 hours

### Priority 2: Testing
**Files to create:**
- `backend/tests/play/test_minimax_ai.py`
- `backend/tests/play/test_evaluation.py`

**What needs to be done:**
1. Unit tests for minimax correctness
2. Test alpha-beta pruning efficiency
3. Test evaluation function accuracy
4. Integration tests with full hands

**Estimated time:** 1-2 hours

### Priority 3: Benchmarking
**Files to create:**
- `backend/benchmarks/benchmark_ai.py`
- `backend/benchmarks/curated_deals.json`

**What needs to be done:**
1. Create 10-20 curated test deals
2. Implement benchmark comparison framework
3. Run baseline: Simple AI
4. Compare: Minimax depth 2 vs depth 3
5. Metrics: tricks won, time per move, nodes searched

**Estimated time:** 2 hours

## 📝 Design Decisions Made

### 1. Evaluation Function Scope
**Decision:** Start minimal (tricks won + sure winners only)
**Rationale:**
- Faster to implement
- Easy to test
- Good baseline
- Can enhance later

**Future enhancements:**
- Trump control
- Communication/entries
- Defensive potential

### 2. Depth Limits
**Decision:** Start with depth 2-3, max 4
**Rationale:**
- Depth 2: ~16 positions (very fast, ~100ms)
- Depth 3: ~64 positions (fast, ~500ms)
- Depth 4: ~256 positions (acceptable, ~2-5s)
- Depth 5+: Too slow for real-time play

**User options:**
- Beginner (Simple AI): Instant
- Intermediate (Minimax depth 2): ~500ms
- Advanced (Minimax depth 3): ~2s

### 3. Perfect Information
**Decision:** Assume all cards visible
**Rationale:**
- Simpler for Phase 2
- Get core minimax working first
- Phase 3 will add sampling for hidden cards
- Still useful for declarer play (sees dummy)

### 4. File Organization
**Decision:** New modular structure now
**Rationale:**
- Better long-term
- Cleaner code organization
- Easier to add Phase 3
- Backward compatible

## 📊 Metrics to Track (Next Session)

When we implement Minimax, track:
1. **Nodes searched** per move
2. **Time per move** (ms)
3. **Tricks won** vs Simple AI
4. **Pruning efficiency** (nodes skipped)
5. **Memory usage** (MB)

## 💭 Questions for Next Session

1. **Move ordering**: Should we try high cards first?
2. **Transposition tables**: Worth adding in Phase 2?
3. **Iterative deepening**: Start shallow, go deeper?
4. **Parallel search**: Multi-threading possible?
