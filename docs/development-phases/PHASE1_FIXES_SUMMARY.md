# Phase 1 Critical Fixes - Progress Summary

**Started:** 2025-10-10
**Status:** In Progress (2/7 complete)

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. Jacoby Transfers - Super-Accept Logic (FIXED)
**File:** `engine/ai/conventions/jacoby_transfers.py`

**Issues Fixed:**
- ‚ùå **OLD:** Checked for doubleton (`hand.suit_lengths['‚ô•'] == 2`)
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Checks for 4-card support (`hand.suit_lengths['‚ô•'] >= 4`)
- ‚ùå **OLD:** Jumped to 2NT with doubleton (worst case!)
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Jumps to 3-level (3‚ô•/3‚ô†) with 4-card support
- ‚ùå **OLD:** Checked `hcp >= 17` (included 18+ HCP hands)
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Checks `hcp == 17` (maximum 1NT exactly)

**Impact:** Super-accepts now work correctly, showing 4-card support with maximum

---

### 2. Jacoby Transfers - Post-Transfer Continuations (FIXED)
**File:** `engine/ai/conventions/jacoby_transfers.py`

**Issues Fixed:**
- Added complete responder continuation logic after transfer completion
- Responder now properly describes strength after transfer:
  * 0-7 HCP: Pass
  * 8-9 HCP: Invite (2NT with 5-card, 3‚ô•/3‚ô† with 6+)
  * 10+ HCP: Bid game (3NT with 5-card, 4‚ô•/4‚ô† with 6+)
- Handles super-accepts correctly (bids game immediately)

**New Methods:**
- `_is_responder_continuation_applicable()`
- `_get_responder_continuation()`

**Impact:** Complete Jacoby Transfer sequences now work end-to-end

### 3. Stayman - Responder Rebids (FIXED)
**File:** `engine/ai/conventions/stayman.py`

**Issues Fixed:**
- Added complete responder rebid logic after opener's Stayman response
- After 2‚ô¶ (no major):
  * 7 HCP: Pass or bid 5-card major
  * 8-9 HCP: Bid 2NT (invitational)
  * 10+ HCP: Bid 3NT (game-forcing)
- After 2‚ô•/2‚ô† with fit:
  * 7 HCP: Pass
  * 8-9 HCP: Invite game (3‚ô•/3‚ô†)
  * 10+ HCP: Bid game (4‚ô•/4‚ô†)
- After 2‚ô•/2‚ô† without fit:
  * 7 HCP: Pass
  * 8-9 HCP: Bid 2NT
  * 10+ HCP: Bid 3NT

**New Methods:**
- `_is_responder_rebid_position()`
- `_get_responder_rebid()`

**Impact:** Complete Stayman sequences now work end-to-end
