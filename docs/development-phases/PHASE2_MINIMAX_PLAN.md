# Phase 2: Minimax AI Implementation Plan

**Status:** Planning Phase
**Target Timeline:** 8-12 hours implementation
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 Complete ✅
**Date Created:** October 11, 2025

---

## 🎯 Phase 2 Objectives

Upgrade the card play AI from simple rule-based logic (Phase 1) to **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**, providing significantly stronger and more strategic play while maintaining the clean, modular architecture established in Phase 1.

### Key Goals
1. ✅ Implement Minimax search with alpha-beta pruning
2. ✅ Create position evaluation function for Bridge
3. ✅ Handle imperfect information (hidden hands)
4. ✅ Maintain Phase 1 pluggable architecture
5. ✅ Achieve reasonable performance (< 5 seconds per move)
6. ✅ Provide better play than Phase 1 simple AI

## 📊 Research Findings

### Bridge AI State of the Art (2024)

From research on current Bridge AI implementations:

**1. Double Dummy Solvers (DDS)**
- Standard approach for perfect-information card play
- Used by top bridge programs worldwide
- DDS library: C++ implementation, widely adopted
- Determines optimal line of play when all cards known

**2. Imperfect Information Handling**
- Generate multiple samples of hidden hands
- Constrain samples based on bidding/play info
- Run double dummy solver on each sample
- Aggregate results for move selection

**3. Minimax with Alpha-Beta**
- Still relevant and effective for Bridge (2024 research confirms)
- Handles trick-based games well
- New information revealed continuously during play
- Good players infer hidden cards from bidding/play

**4. Evaluation Functions**
- "Sure winners" - definitive lower bound on tricks
- Relatively inexpensive to compute
- Improves pruning efficiency
- Better than approximations used in other games

## 🏗️ Phase 2 Architecture

### Design Principles

Following our successful Phase 1 modular architecture:

```
PlayEngine (unchanged)
    ↓
PlayAI Interface (unchanged)
    ↓
    ├─ SimplePlayAI (Phase 1) ✅
    ├─ MinimaxPlayAI (Phase 2) ← NEW
    └─ DDSPlayAI (Phase 3) ← Future
```

**Key Insight:** The `PlayEngine` core remains **completely unchanged**. We're simply adding a new AI implementation.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. Abstract Base Class (`base_ai.py`)

**Purpose:** Define interface all AI implementations must follow

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from engine.play_engine import PlayState, Card
from typing import Optional, Tuple

class BasePlayAI(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for all card play AI implementations

    This ensures all AI strategies (Simple, Minimax, DDS) have
    consistent interfaces and can be swapped without code changes.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def choose_card(self, state: PlayState, position: str) -> Card:
        """
        Choose which card to play

        Args:
            state: Current play state
            position: Position making the play ('N', 'E', 'S', 'W')

        Returns:
            Card to play
        """
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def get_name(self) -> str:
        """Return human-readable name of this AI"""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def get_difficulty(self) -> str:
        """Return difficulty level: 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced'"""
        pass

    def get_explanation(self, card: Card, state: PlayState) -> str:
        """
        Optional: Provide explanation for why this card was chosen

        Default implementation returns basic info.
        Override for more detailed explanations.
        """
        return f"Played {card.rank}{card.suit}"
```

**Benefits:**
- Type safety
- Enforces consistent interface
- Enables dependency injection
- Simplifies testing

### 2. Position Evaluation Function (`evaluation.py`)

**Purpose:** Evaluate how good a card play position is

```python
from engine.play_engine import PlayState, Card
from typing import Dict, List

class PositionEvaluator:
    """
    Evaluates bridge card play positions

    This is the "brain" of the Minimax AI - it determines which
    positions are favorable and by how much.
    """

    def evaluate(self, state: PlayState, perspective: str) -> float:
        """
        Evaluate position from given player's perspective

        Args:

**Evaluation Components (Priority Order):**

1. **Tricks Won** (Weight: 1.0) - Already decided
2. **Sure Winners** (Weight: 0.5) - High cards that must win
3. **Trump Control** (Weight: 0.3) - Length and strength in trumps
4. **Communication** (Weight: 0.2) - Entries between hands
5. **Defensive Potential** (Weight: 0.15) - For defenders only

**Performance Optimizations:**

1. **Alpha-Beta Pruning** - Reduces search space by ~50-90%
2. **Move Ordering** - Try most promising moves first
3. **Transposition Tables** - Cache evaluated positions (Phase 2.1)
4. **Depth Limiting** - Stop search at reasonable depth

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

```python
# tests/play/test_minimax_ai.py

def test_minimax_chooses_winning_line():
    """Test that minimax finds forced winning line"""
    deal = create_test_deal(
        north="♠A ♥A ♦A ♣AKQJ",      # All winners in dummy
        south="♠K ♥K ♦K ♣23456",      # Declarer
        east="♠Q ♥Q ♦Q ♣789T",
        west="♠J ♥J ♦J ♣—"
    )

    play_state = create_play_scenario("3NT by S", deal)

    simple_ai = SimplePlayAI()
    minimax_ai = MinimaxPlayAI(max_depth=3)

    # Play out hand with both AIs
    simple_result = simulate_full_play(play_state, simple_ai)
    minimax_result = simulate_full_play(play_state, minimax_ai)

    # Minimax should make contract (9+ tricks)
    assert minimax_result.tricks_taken_ns >= 9
    # Minimax should be at least as good as simple
    assert minimax_result.tricks_taken_ns >= simple_result.tricks_taken_ns
```

### Benchmark Tests

```python
# benchmarks/benchmark_ai.py

def benchmark_ai_comparison():
    """Compare AI strategies on standard deals"""

    results = {
        'simple': {'tricks': 0, 'time': 0},
        'minimax_d2': {'tricks': 0, 'time': 0},
        'minimax_d4': {'tricks': 0, 'time': 0}
    }

    for deal in load_standard_deals():
        # Test each AI
        for ai_name, ai in [
            ('simple', SimplePlayAI()),
            ('minimax_d2', MinimaxPlayAI(max_depth=2)),
            ('minimax_d4', MinimaxPlayAI(max_depth=4))
        ]:
            start = time.time()
            result = simulate_full_play(deal, ai)
            elapsed = time.time() - start

            results[ai_name]['tricks'] += result.tricks_taken_ns
            results[ai_name]['time'] += elapsed

    print_benchmark_report(results)
```

**Expected Results:**
- Minimax (depth 2): +1-2 tricks vs Simple, <2s per move
- Minimax (depth 4): +2-3 tricks vs Simple, <5s per move

## 🚧 Known Limitations (Phase 2)

### Not Addressed in Phase 2

1. **Imperfect Information**
   - Phase 2 assumes perfect information (all cards visible)
   - Real bridge has hidden cards
   - **Solution:** Phase 3 will sample possible hands

2. **No End-Game Solving**
   - Doesn't use double dummy solver
   - May miss complex end positions
   - **Solution:** Phase 3 integrates DDS

3. **Limited Opening Lead Strategy**
   - Still uses simple heuristics for leads
   - Doesn't consider bidding info
   - **Solution:** Future enhancement

4. **No Learning**
   - Fixed evaluation weights
   - Doesn't improve over time
   - **Solution:** Future ML enhancement

### Phase 2 Scope Boundaries

**IN SCOPE:**
- ✅ Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- ✅ Position evaluation function
- ✅ Depth-limited search
- ✅ Basic optimizations

**OUT OF SCOPE:**
- ❌ Perfect information handling → Phase 3
- ❌ Double dummy solver integration → Phase 3
- ❌ Machine learning → Future
- ❌ Opening lead strategy → Future
- ❌ Bidding integration → Separate

## 📊 Migration Path

### For Existing Code

**No breaking changes!** Phase 2 is 100% backward compatible.

```python
# Phase 1 code continues to work
from engine.simple_play_ai import SimplePlayAI
ai = SimplePlayAI()

# Phase 2 adds new option
from engine.play.ai.minimax_ai import MinimaxPlayAI
ai = MinimaxPlayAI(max_depth=4)

# Both implement same interface
card = ai.choose_card(play_state, position)
```

### For Tests

```python
# Old tests work unchanged
def test_play_scenario():
    ai = SimplePlayAI()
    # ... test logic

# New tests use parametrization
@pytest.mark.parametrize("ai", [
    SimplePlayAI(),
    MinimaxPlayAI(max_depth=2),
    MinimaxPlayAI(max_depth=4)
])
def test_play_scenario(ai):
    # ... test logic works with any AI
```

  { value: 'minimax-2', label: 'Intermediate (2s)', ai: 'MinimaxPlayAI', depth: 2 },
  { value: 'minimax-4', label: 'Advanced (5s)', ai: 'MinimaxPlayAI', depth: 4 }
]
```

### API Endpoint

```python
@app.route('/api/play/set-ai-difficulty', methods=['POST'])
def set_ai_difficulty():
    """Allow users to choose AI difficulty"""
    data = request.get_json()
    difficulty = data.get('difficulty', 'simple')

    if difficulty == 'simple':
        play_ai = SimplePlayAI()
    elif difficulty == 'minimax-2':
        play_ai = MinimaxPlayAI(max_depth=2)
    elif difficulty == 'minimax-4':
        play_ai = MinimaxPlayAI(max_depth=4)

    return jsonify({'success': True, 'ai': play_ai.get_name()})
```
