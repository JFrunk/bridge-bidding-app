# Step-by-Step Gameplay Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide will walk you through testing the complete bidding + card play workflow in your Bridge Bidding App, from dealing a hand through bidding to playing out all 13 tricks and seeing the final score.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have both backend and frontend running:

### Terminal 1 - Backend Server
```bash
cd /Users/simonroy/Desktop/bridge_bidding_app/backend
source venv/bin/activate  # If using virtual environment
python3 server.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5001
```

### Terminal 2 - Frontend Server
```bash
cd /Users/simonroy/Desktop/bridge_bidding_app/frontend
npm start
```

**Expected output:**
```
Compiled successfully!
You can now view frontend in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Method 1: Full Workflow Test (Bidding ‚Üí Playing)

This tests the complete integration from bidding through card play.

### Step 1: Open the Application

1. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000
2. You should see the Bridge Bidding App interface

### Step 2: Deal a Hand

**Action:** Click the **"Deal New Hand"** button

**What to verify:**
- ‚úÖ You see your hand (South position) with 13 cards
- ‚úÖ Hand Analysis panel shows HCP, distribution points, suit breakdown
- ‚úÖ Vulnerability indicator shows (e.g., "Vuln: None")
- ‚úÖ Bidding table is empty and ready
- ‚úÖ Bidding box is enabled (level buttons 1-7 clickable)

**Troubleshooting:**
- If no hand appears, check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
- Verify backend server is running on port 5001

### Step 3: Complete the Bidding

You need to reach a contract and then have 3 consecutive passes.

**Example Bidding Sequence (3NT contract):**

1. **North opens:**
   - AI automatically bids (watch bidding table)
   - Example: "1NT" (15-17 HCP balanced)

2. **East passes:**
   - AI automatically passes

3. **Your turn (South):**
   - Click level "3"
   - Click "NT"
   - Your bid "3NT" appears in the table

4. **West passes:**
   - AI automatically passes

5. **North passes:**
   - AI automatically passes

6. **East passes:**
   - AI automatically passes

**What to verify at this stage:**
- ‚úÖ Bidding table shows all bids in 4 columns (N/E/S/W)
- ‚úÖ Current player indicator (yellow highlight) moves correctly
- ‚úÖ You can only bid when it's South's turn
- ‚úÖ Bid legality is enforced (can't bid 1‚ô† after 3NT)
- ‚úÖ After 3 consecutive passes, bidding is complete

**Common bidding sequences to try:**
- **1NT - Pass - 3NT - Pass - Pass - Pass** (Simple NT contract)
- **1‚ô† - Pass - 4‚ô† - Pass - Pass - Pass** (Major suit game)
- **1‚ô£ - 1‚ô† - 2NT - Pass - 3NT - Pass - Pass - Pass** (Competitive)

### Step 4: Automatic Transition to Play Phase

**What happens automatically:**
After the 3rd consecutive pass, the app should:

1. **Detect bidding is complete**
2. **Display transition message:**
   - "Contract: 3NT by North. Opening leader: East"
   - (or whatever the contract and positions are)
3. **Switch to play view** (may take 1-2 seconds)

**What to verify:**
- ‚úÖ Bidding table is replaced by play table
- ‚úÖ Contract is displayed prominently (e.g., "3NT by N")
- ‚úÖ Tricks won counters show: NS: 0, EW: 0
- ‚úÖ Play area appears in center with 4 position labels

**Troubleshooting:**
- If transition doesn't happen, check browser console for errors
- Verify `/api/start-play` endpoint is responding (check Network tab in dev tools)

### Step 5: Opening Lead

**What happens:**
- The opening leader (LHO of declarer) automatically plays a card
- You'll see a message: "W played J‚ô†" (or whatever card)
- The card appears in the center play area

**What to verify:**
- ‚úÖ Opening leader is correct (LHO of declarer)
- ‚úÖ Card appears in the center
- ‚úÖ Position label shows who played it (N, E, S, or W)

### Step 6: Dummy Revealed

**What happens after opening lead:**
- Dummy hand (partner of declarer) is revealed
- You can see all 13 cards in dummy's hand
- Dummy's cards are displayed face-up

**What to verify:**
- ‚úÖ Dummy position is correct (partner of declarer)
- ‚úÖ All 13 dummy cards are visible
- ‚úÖ Dummy cards are organized by suit
- ‚úÖ Label shows "(Dummy)" next to position name

**Example:**
```
If contract is "3NT by South":
- Declarer: South (you)
- Dummy: North (partner)
- Opening leader: West (LHO of South)
- Defenders: East and West
```

### Step 7: Watch AI Players

**What happens:**
- AI players (North, East, West) automatically play cards in sequence
- Each card play is announced: "E played 5‚ô†"
- Cards appear in center play area
- Short delay (~1 second) between each AI card

**What to verify:**
- ‚úÖ AI players play in correct order (clockwise: W ‚Üí N ‚Üí E ‚Üí S)
- ‚úÖ Each card appears in the center
- ‚úÖ Messages announce each play
- ‚úÖ AI follows suit rules (plays same suit if they have it)

### Step 8: Your Turn to Play

**When it's your turn (South):**

**Visual cues:**
- Message: "Your turn to play!"
- Your cards should be clickable (cursor changes to pointer on hover)
- Position label shows "‚¨ÖÔ∏è Your turn!"

**Action:**
1. Hover over your cards - they should highlight or show hover effect
2. Click a card to play it

**What to verify:**
- ‚úÖ Only legal cards are clickable (must follow suit if able)
- ‚úÖ Clicking a card plays it to the center
- ‚úÖ Card is removed from your hand
- ‚úÖ Play continues automatically with next AI player

**Testing illegal plays:**
- Try clicking a card in a different suit when you have the led suit
- Should see error: "Must follow suit if able"

### Step 9: Trick Completion

**When 4 cards have been played:**

**What happens:**
1. **Winner determined** - Highest card in trump suit (or led suit if NT)
2. **Winner highlighted** - Card that won is marked with "Winner!" badge
3. **Winner announced** - "North wins the trick!"
4. **Tricks won updated** - Counter increments (e.g., NS: 1, EW: 0)
5. **Brief pause** (~2-3 seconds) to see the trick
6. **Trick cleared** - Cards removed from center
7. **Next trick starts** - Winner leads to next trick

**What to verify:**
- ‚úÖ Correct card wins (highest trump, or highest in led suit)
- ‚úÖ Winner is clearly indicated
- ‚úÖ Tricks won counter updates correctly
- ‚úÖ Next trick starts with winner leading

**Trick-taking rules to verify:**
- Highest card in led suit wins (if no trumps played)
- Any trump beats any non-trump
- Highest trump wins (if multiple trumps played)

### Step 10: Continue Playing

**Repeat steps 7-9 for all 13 tricks:**

Watch the trick count increment:
- After trick 1: NS: 1, EW: 0 (or whatever the result)
- After trick 2: NS: 1, EW: 1 (or whatever)
- Continue until all 13 tricks played...

**What to verify during play:**
- ‚úÖ Hand counts decrease (you start with 13, end with 0)
- ‚úÖ Dummy hand cards also decrease
- ‚úÖ AI follows basic bridge strategy
- ‚úÖ No crashes or freezes

**Progress milestones:**
- üìä After 3 tricks: Game is flowing
- üìä After 7 tricks: Contract status becoming clear
- üìä After 10 tricks: Almost done
- üìä After 13 tricks: Final score coming!

### Step 11: Final Score Display

**After 13 tricks are played:**

**What happens:**
- Score modal/overlay appears automatically
- Shows contract details and result

**Modal should display:**
```
Hand Complete!

Contract: 3NT by S
Tricks Taken: 9
Result: Made exactly
Score: +400
```

**What to verify:**
- ‚úÖ Contract shown correctly
- ‚úÖ Tricks taken is accurate
- ‚úÖ Result is correct:
  - "Made exactly" (took exactly what needed)
  - "Made +1" (took 1 overtrick)
  - "Down 1" (failed by 1 trick)
- ‚úÖ Score calculation is correct
- ‚úÖ Close button is visible

**Score verification:**
Common scores for reference:
- 3NT making exactly (non-vul): +400
- 3NT +1 (non-vul): +430
- 3NT -1 (non-vul): -50
- 4‚ô† making exactly (non-vul): +420
- 4‚ô† doubled making (vul): +790

### Step 12: Close and Repeat

**Action:**
- Click "Close" button on score modal

**What happens:**
- Modal closes
- You return to the main screen
- Ready to deal a new hand

**What to verify:**
- ‚úÖ Modal closes cleanly
- ‚úÖ Can click "Deal New Hand" again
- ‚úÖ New hand deals correctly
- ‚úÖ State is properly reset

## Method 2: Testing Standalone Play (No Bidding)

This tests the play module independently using the new modular architecture.

### Step 1: Open Python Console

```bash
cd /Users/simonroy/Desktop/bridge_bidding_app/backend
source venv/bin/activate
python3
```

### Step 2: Run Complete Test Example

```python
from tests.play_test_helpers import create_test_deal, create_play_scenario, print_hand_diagram
from engine.simple_play_ai import SimplePlayAI
from engine.play_engine import PlayEngine

# Create a deal
deal = create_test_deal(
    north="‚ô†AKQ2 ‚ô•432 ‚ô¶KQJ ‚ô£432",
    east="‚ô†765 ‚ô•765 ‚ô¶765 ‚ô£7654",
    south="‚ô†432 ‚ô•AKQ ‚ô¶A32 ‚ô£AKQ8",
    west="‚ô†JT98 ‚ô•JT98 ‚ô¶T98 ‚ô£J9"
)

# Create play scenario
play_state = create_play_scenario("3NT by S", deal, "None")

# Show diagram
print_hand_diagram(deal, play_state.contract)

# Initialize AI
ai = SimplePlayAI()

# Play one trick
print("\n=== PLAYING TRICK 1 ===")

# West leads
print(f"\n{play_state.next_to_play} to play...")
card = ai.choose_card(play_state, play_state.next_to_play)
print(f"{play_state.next_to_play} plays {card.rank}{card.suit}")
play_state.current_trick.append((card, play_state.next_to_play))
play_state.hands[play_state.next_to_play].cards.remove(card)
play_state.next_to_play = PlayEngine.next_player(play_state.next_to_play)

# North plays
print(f"\n{play_state.next_to_play} to play...")
play_state.dummy_revealed = True
card = ai.choose_card(play_state, play_state.next_to_play)
print(f"{play_state.next_to_play} plays {card.rank}{card.suit}")
play_state.current_trick.append((card, play_state.next_to_play))
play_state.hands[play_state.next_to_play].cards.remove(card)
play_state.next_to_play = PlayEngine.next_player(play_state.next_to_play)

# East plays
print(f"\n{play_state.next_to_play} to play...")
card = ai.choose_card(play_state, play_state.next_to_play)
print(f"{play_state.next_to_play} plays {card.rank}{card.suit}")
play_state.current_trick.append((card, play_state.next_to_play))
play_state.hands[play_state.next_to_play].cards.remove(card)
play_state.next_to_play = PlayEngine.next_player(play_state.next_to_play)

# South plays
print(f"\n{play_state.next_to_play} to play...")
card = ai.choose_card(play_state, play_state.next_to_play)
print(f"{play_state.next_to_play} plays {card.rank}{card.suit}")
play_state.current_trick.append((card, play_state.next_to_play))
play_state.hands[play_state.next_to_play].cards.remove(card)

# Determine winner
winner = PlayEngine.determine_trick_winner(
    play_state.current_trick,
    play_state.contract.trump_suit
)
print(f"\nüèÜ {winner} wins the trick!")

# Update state
play_state.tricks_won[winner] += 1
print(f"\nTricks won: NS={play_state.tricks_taken_ns}, EW={play_state.tricks_taken_ew}")

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Play Phase Doesn't Start

**Symptoms:**
- Bidding completes but nothing happens
- No transition to play view

**Check:**
1. Browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Network tab - is `/api/start-play` being called?
3. Backend logs - any errors in Flask output?

**Fix:**
- Ensure auction has exactly 3 consecutive passes
- Verify at least one real bid was made (not all passes)
- Check that `gamePhase` state changes to 'playing'

### Issue 2: Cards Not Clickable

**Symptoms:**
- Your turn but cards don't respond to clicks
- No hover effect on cards

**Check:**
1. Is `isUserTurn` prop true for PlayTable?
2. Is `isPlayingCard` state false?
3. Browser console for errors

**Fix:**
- Verify `playState.next_to_play === 'S'`
- Check that AI play loop isn't stuck
- Reload page and try again

### Issue 3: Illegal Play Error

**Symptoms:**
- Click card and get error message
- "Must follow suit if able"

**Check:**
- Do you have cards in the led suit?
- Are you trying to play wrong suit?

**Fix:**
- This is correct behavior!
- Play a card in the led suit
- Or verify you truly have a void in that suit

### Issue 4: Score Not Showing

**Symptoms:**
- All 13 tricks played but no score modal
- Game seems stuck

**Check:**
1. Browser console for errors
2. Network tab - is `/api/complete-play` being called?
3. Are all 13 tricks actually recorded?

**Fix:**
- Check `tricks_won` totals: N + E + S + W should equal 13
- Verify `totalTricks === 13` in code
- Check Flask logs for scoring calculation errors

### Issue 5: Backend Errors

**Symptoms:**
- HTTP 500 errors
- "Server error" messages

**Check:**
1. Flask terminal for Python traceback
2. Is `current_play_state` null?
3. Hand data available?

**Fix:**
- Restart Flask server
- Re-deal hands
- Check that `/api/start-play` was called successfully
