# How to Test Session Isolation

**Purpose:** Verify that multiple users can play simultaneously without interfering with each other's games.

**Why This Matters:** Session isolation is the #1 critical fix from the CTO review (ADR-001). We replaced global variables with session-based state to enable multi-user support.

## üéØ What We're Testing

**Session isolation means:**
- ‚úÖ Each browser window has its own independent game
- ‚úÖ Cards in Window A don't appear in Window B
- ‚úÖ Playing a card in Window A doesn't affect Window B
- ‚úÖ Different vulnerability settings per session
- ‚úÖ Different AI difficulty per session
- ‚úÖ No "card stealing" or state corruption

## üìã Quick Test (5 minutes)

### **Step 1: Open Two Browser Windows**

**Option A: Two Different Browsers**
- Window 1: Chrome ‚Üí http://localhost:3000
- Window 2: Firefox ‚Üí http://localhost:3000

**Option B: Same Browser (Incognito/Private)**
- Window 1: Chrome (normal) ‚Üí http://localhost:3000
- Window 2: Chrome (Incognito) ‚Üí http://localhost:3000

**Option C: Same Browser (Different Windows)**
- Window 1: Chrome ‚Üí http://localhost:3000
- Window 2: Chrome (new window) ‚Üí http://localhost:3000

**Note:** Option A or B is best because they guarantee different sessions.

### **Step 2: Start a Game in BOTH Windows**

**Window 1:**
1. Click "Deal New Hand" or "Start Practice"
2. Note the cards you received (e.g., "I have ‚ô†AKQ...")
3. Note the vulnerability (e.g., "None")

**Window 2:**
1. Click "Deal New Hand" or "Start Practice"
2. Note the cards you received
3. Note the vulnerability

**‚úÖ PASS Criteria:**
- Window 1 and Window 2 have **different cards**
- If they have the same cards, that's a bug (session isolation failed)

---

### **Step 3: Play Cards Simultaneously**

**Window 1:**
1. Complete bidding (or skip to play phase)
2. Play a card (e.g., ‚ô†A)
3. Leave it there (don't complete the trick)

**Window 2:**
1. Complete bidding (or skip to play phase)
2. Check if Window 2's cards changed
3. Play a card in Window 2

**‚úÖ PASS Criteria:**
- Playing a card in Window 1 does **NOT** affect Window 2
- Window 2 still has its original cards
- No cards disappeared or changed

---

### **Step 4: Verify Session Persistence**

**Window 1:**
1. Note your current game state (tricks won, current trick)
2. Refresh the page (Cmd+R or F5)
3. Check if your game state persisted

**‚úÖ PASS Criteria:**
- After refresh, you return to the same game
- Your session ID persists (stored in localStorage)
- Cards and game state are the same

4. Note the session ID (e.g., `session_1697123456_abc123`)

5. **Window 2:** Open browser DevTools
6. Type: `localStorage.getItem('bridge_session_id')`
7. Note the session ID

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Window 1 and Window 2 have **different session IDs**
- ‚úÖ Session IDs follow format: `session_<timestamp>_<random>`

**Failure Example:**
- ‚ùå Both windows have the same session ID

---

### **Test 7: Session Header Verification**

**Check API Calls:**

1. **Window 1:** Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
2. Deal a hand
3. Find the `/api/deal-hands` request
4. Click it ‚Üí Headers tab

## üö® Common Issues & Fixes

### **Issue: Both Windows Show Same Cards**

**Symptoms:**
- Window 1 and Window 2 have identical hands

**Cause:**
- Session isolation not working
- Likely using same session ID

**Fix:**
1. Clear localStorage in both windows:
   - DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage ‚Üí Clear
2. Refresh both windows (Cmd+R)
3. Deal new hands

**If still broken:**
- Check backend logs for session ID usage
- Verify `X-Session-ID` headers are different

---

### **Issue: Cards Disappear Across Windows**

**Symptoms:**
- Playing a card in Window 1 removes it from Window 2

**Cause:**
- Backend using global state (session isolation failed)

**Fix:**
1. Check backend server.py uses `get_state()` not global variables
2. Restart backend server
3. Clear frontend cache

**This is a CRITICAL bug** - report immediately if found!

---

### **Issue: Session Lost After Refresh**

**Symptoms:**
- Refreshing page starts a new game

**Cause:**
- Session ID not persisting in localStorage

**Fix:**
1. Check localStorage has `bridge_session_id`
2. Verify sessionHelper.js is working
3. Check browser isn't in private/incognito mode

---

## ‚úÖ Pass/Fail Criteria

### **‚úÖ PASS - Session Isolation Works**

- Different cards in each window
- Playing cards doesn't affect other windows
- Different session IDs in each window
- X-Session-ID headers are sent and unique
- No crashes with multiple concurrent users
- Session persists after refresh

- Same cards appear in multiple windows
- Playing a card in one window affects another
- Missing X-Session-ID headers
- Same session ID in multiple windows
- Crashes or errors with concurrent users
- Random state corruption
