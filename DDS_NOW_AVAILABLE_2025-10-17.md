# DDS Now Available - Updated Recommendations

## Important Discovery

**DDS (Double Dummy Solver) IS actually installed and working!**

When running via the venv, DDS is fully functional:

```bash
$ ./venv/bin/python3 -c "from engine.play.ai.dds_ai import DDS_AVAILABLE; print(DDS_AVAILABLE)"
True
```

## Current Server Configuration

**When server runs with venv:**
```
‚úÖ DDS IS AVAILABLE - Expert AI will use Double Dummy Solver (9/10)
üéØ Default AI Difficulty: advanced
   Engine: Minimax AI (depth 3)
   Rating: ~advanced

AI instances configured:
   beginner    : Simple Rule-Based AI
   intermediate: Minimax AI (depth 2)
üëâ advanced    : Minimax AI (depth 3)    ‚Üê Current default
   expert      : Double Dummy Solver AI  ‚Üê 9/10 available!
```

## Updated Recommendation

Since DDS IS available and working in the venv, you have TWO options:

### Option 1: Keep Default as "Advanced" (Current - Safe)

**Pros:**
- Safe for macOS development (if DDS has issues, doesn't affect default)
- Fast response times (~1-3 seconds)
- Still good gameplay (7/10)

**Cons:**
- Not using the full 9/10 capability even though it's available
- The ‚ô•K discard error could still happen (though less likely at depth 3)

### Option 2: Change Default to "Expert" (Recommended for Testing)

**Pros:**
- Uses full 9/10 DDS capability
- **Would NEVER make the ‚ô•K discard error**
- Perfect double-dummy play
- True production-quality gameplay

**Cons:**
- Slower (10-200ms per move, still fast)
- If DDS crashes on your Mac, would need to manually set difficulty lower

## My Recommendation: Test "Expert" Default

Since DDS is working, I recommend **changing the default to "expert"** for your development environment to:
1. Test the full 9/10 gameplay
2. Verify DDS stability on your macOS system
3. Ensure the ‚ô•K discard issue never happens again

### How to Change Default to Expert

**Option A: Environment Variable (Temporary Test)**
```bash
export DEFAULT_AI_DIFFICULTY=expert
python server.py
```

**Option B: Code Change (Permanent)**
In `backend/core/session_state.py` line 45:
```python
DEFAULT_AI_DIFFICULTY = os.environ.get('DEFAULT_AI_DIFFICULTY', 'expert')
```

## Testing DDS Stability

To verify DDS is stable on your macOS system:

```bash
# Run this test 10 times
for i in {1..10}; do
  echo "Test $i"
  PYTHONPATH=. ./venv/bin/python3 -c "
from engine.play.ai.dds_ai import DDSPlayAI, DDS_AVAILABLE
from endplay.types import Deal
from endplay.dds import calc_dd_table

if DDS_AVAILABLE:
    deal = Deal('N:AKQ2.AKQ2.AKQ2.AK 432.432.432.432 876.876.876.876 JT5.JT5.JT5.JT5')
    table = calc_dd_table(deal)
    print(f'‚úÖ Test $i passed: NT tricks = {table.to_list()[4][0]}')
else:
    print('‚ùå DDS not available')
"
done
```

If all 10 tests pass without crashes, DDS is stable on your system and you can safely use `expert` as the default.

## Summary Table

| Configuration | Default AI | DDS Available? | Rating | Response Time | ‚ô•K Error Risk |
|---------------|------------|----------------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Before Fix** | intermediate | ‚ùå No (thought) | 5-6/10 | 100-500ms | ‚ùå High |
| **After Fix (current)** | advanced | ‚úÖ Yes | 7/10 | 1-3s | ‚ö†Ô∏è Low |
| **Recommended** | expert | ‚úÖ Yes | 9/10 | 10-200ms | ‚úÖ None |

## Key Points

1. **DDS is already installed** in your venv (endplay 0.5.12)
2. **DDS is working** - successfully calculates double dummy tables
3. **Your macOS might be stable** with DDS (needs testing)
4. **Current default (advanced)** is safer but not optimal
5. **Expert default** gives you full 9/10 gameplay if DDS is stable

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test DDS stability on your macOS (run the test above)
2. If stable: Change default to `expert`
3. If unstable: Keep `advanced` default for dev, `expert` for production
4. Either way: The current fix (advanced) is already a huge improvement over intermediate

---

**Bottom Line:** You already have 9/10 gameplay available via DDS. The question is whether to use it by default in development, or keep the safer 7/10 (advanced) default and manually select expert when needed.
