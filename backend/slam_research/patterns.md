# Expert Slam Bidding - Pattern Tracking

## NT Slam Patterns

### 1NT Opening Sequences
| Responder HCP | Bid | Expert Reasoning | Source |
|---------------|-----|------------------|--------|
| 15-17 | 4NT | Quantitative invite | Larry Cohen |
| 18-19 | 4NT | Strong invite | ACBL SAYC |
| 10-14 | 3NT | Signoff | Standard |

**Questions to Research**:
- Does opener ever bid over 3NT with 17 HCP maximum?
- What hand types justify quantitative 4NT with 15 HCP?
- When does responder go straight to 6NT vs 4NT invite?

## Blackwood Usage Patterns

### When Experts Use 4NT as Blackwood
1. ✅ Clear trump fit established
2. ✅ 32+ combined points minimum
3. ✅ Game-forcing auction
4. ❌ After NT opening (usually quantitative)
5. ❌ When no clear trump suit

### When 4NT is Quantitative
1. ✅ NT opening, balanced continuation
2. ✅ No suit agreement
3. ✅ After 1NT/2NT/3NT bids
4. ❌ In suit auctions with fit

## Conservative Bidding Patterns

### When Experts Stop at Game (33-35 pts)
Reasons observed:
- Missing aces (would lose 2+ quick tricks)
- Poor suit quality (no solid suit)
- 4-3 fit vs 5-3 fit
- Flat distribution (4333, 4432)
