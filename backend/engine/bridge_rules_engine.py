"""
Bridge Rules Engine - Encodes Official Bridge Laws

This module implements the core rules of contract bridge regarding:
1. Hand visibility (who can see which hands)
2. Play control (who controls which positions)
3. Turn determination (whose turn is it to play)

References:
- Laws of Duplicate Bridge (2017)
- Law 41: Dummy's Rights and Limitations
- Law 45: Card Play Procedure

Design Principles:
- Declarative: Rules are encoded as pure functions
- Testable: All edge cases have explicit test coverage
- Single Source of Truth: Both frontend and backend use this engine
- Self-Documenting: Code reads like the rulebook

    Key Bridge Rules Implemented:

    1. DECLARER CONTROL (Law 45):
       - Declarer controls BOTH their own hand AND dummy's hand
       - Declarer makes all decisions for dummy
       - Dummy makes NO decisions (passive role)

    2. DEFENDER CONTROL:
       - Each defender controls ONLY their own hand
       - Defenders cannot see or control partner's hand

    3. HAND VISIBILITY (Law 41):
       - Before opening lead: Only player's own hand visible
       - After opening lead: Dummy is revealed to ALL players
       - Declarer sees: Own hand + Dummy (2 hands)
       - Defenders see: Own hand + Dummy (2 hands)
       - Dummy player sees: Own hand + Declarer's hand (2 hands) [if human is dummy]

    4. TURN SEQUENCING:
       - Opening lead: Left-hand opponent (LHO) of declarer leads first
       - After opening lead: Play proceeds clockwise
       - Winner of trick leads to next trick
