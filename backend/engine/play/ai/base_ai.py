Abstract base class for all card play AI implementations

This defines the interface that all AI strategies must implement,
ensuring consistency and enabling easy testing and comparison.

class BasePlayAI(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for Bridge card play AI

    All AI implementations (Simple, Minimax, DDS, etc.) must extend this
    class and implement the required methods. This ensures a consistent
    interface across all AI strategies.

    Example:
        >>> class MyAI(BasePlayAI):
        ...     def choose_card(self, state, position):
        ...         return state.hands[position].cards[0]  # First card
        ...     def get_name(self):
        ...         return "My Simple AI"
        ...     def get_difficulty(self):
        ...         return "beginner"

        """
        Choose which card to play from given position

        This is the main method that PlayEngine calls to get the AI's
        card choice. The AI should analyze the current state and return
        the best card to play.

        Args:
            state: Current play state (includes contract, hands, tricks, etc.)
            position: Position making the play ('N', 'E', 'S', 'W')

        Returns:
            Card to play (must be legal according to Bridge rules)

        Raises:
            ValueError: If no legal card can be found (shouldn't happen)

        Example:
            >>> ai = SimplePlayAI()
            >>> card = ai.choose_card(play_state, 'N')

        Example:
