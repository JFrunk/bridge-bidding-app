## 🔧 Fixes Implemented

### 1. Jacoby Transfers (CRITICAL BUG FIXED)
**Files:** `engine/ai/conventions/jacoby_transfers.py`

**Issue #1:** Super-accept logic was completely backwards
- OLD: Checked for doubleton (`== 2`) instead of 4-card support
- OLD: Bid 2NT with doubleton (worst possible holding!)
- FIX: Changed to check `>= 4` card support and bid `3♥`/`3♠`

**Issue #2:** Missing post-transfer continuations
- FIX: Added complete responder rebid logic based on strength:
  - 0-7 HCP: Pass
  - 8-9 HCP: Invite (2NT or 3 of major)
  - 10+ HCP: Game (3NT or 4 of major)

### 2. Stayman (MISSING LOGIC)
**Files:** `engine/ai/conventions/stayman.py`

**Issue:** No responder rebid logic after opener's response
- FIX: Added complete rebid logic for:
  - No fit scenarios (2NT invite, 3NT game)
  - Fit found scenarios (Pass, 3-level invite, 4-level game)

### 3. Takeout Doubles (INTERFACE & HCP)
**Files:** `engine/ai/conventions/takeout_doubles.py`

**Issue #1:** Missing `ConventionModule` interface
- FIX: Added proper imports and inheritance

**Issue #2:** HCP requirement was 13+ instead of 12+
- FIX: Changed `if hand.hcp < 13` to `if hand.hcp < 12`

### 4. Blackwood (MISSING LOGIC + DECISION ENGINE BUG)
**Files:** `engine/ai/conventions/blackwood.py`, `engine/ai/decision_engine.py`

**Issue #1:** No signoff logic after receiving ace response
- FIX: Added complete signoff decision tree:
  - 0-2 aces: Sign off at 5-level
  - 3 aces: Bid small slam (6-level)
  - 4 aces: Can ask for kings with 5NT

**Issue #2:** No king-asking (5NT) logic
- FIX: Implemented 5NT king ask and step responses

**Issue #3:** Decision engine didn't check Blackwood for responder
- FIX: Added Blackwood check in partner-opened section (line 64-67)

### 5. Preempts (MISSING LEVELS)
**Files:** `engine/ai/conventions/preempts.py`

**Issue #1:** Only 2-level preempts existed
- FIX: Added complete preempt ladder:
  - 2-level: 6-card suit, 6-10 HCP
  - 3-level: 7-card suit, 6-10 HCP
  - 4-level: 8-card suit, 6-10 HCP
  - Priority: Longer suits bid first

**Issue #2:** Response logic only handled 2-level preempts
- FIX: Extended response logic for 3/4-level preempts

### 6. Negative Doubles (PARTIAL FIX)
**Files:** `engine/ai/conventions/negative_doubles.py`, `engine/ai/decision_engine.py`, `engine/bidding_engine.py`

**✅ Fixed - Level-Adjusted HCP:**
- Through 2♠: 6+ HCP
- 3-level: 8+ HCP
- 4-level+: 12+ HCP

**✅ Fixed - Applicability Logic:**
- Removed strict "exactly 2 non-pass bids" requirement
- Now handles balancing positions

**✅ Fixed - Decision Engine Integration:**
- Added negative doubles check in partner-opened section
- Registered module in BiddingEngine

**❌ Known Issue - Auction Position Detection:**
The `_is_applicable` method isn't correctly detecting when an opponent has overcalled after partner opened. The auction interpretation needs fixing to properly identify competitive situations.

**Root Cause:** The auction list doesn't encode position information directly, so determining "who bid what" requires careful index calculation that's currently not working correctly for negative doubles.

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Critical Issue: Negative Doubles Auction Detection
**Status:** Partially implemented
**Impact:** Negative doubles don't trigger in test scenarios
**Tests Affected:** 5/7 negative double tests failing

**Technical Details:**
The negative double module returns `None` because `_is_applicable()` can't correctly detect:
1. Partner opened (✅ detects this)
2. Opponent overcalled (❌ fails to detect this)
3. It's our turn to bid (✅ detects this)

The auction `['1♣', 'Pass', '1♥', 'Pass']` should represent:
- North: 1♣ (partner)
- East: Pass
- South: ??? (opponent's 1♥ overcall, but detected wrong)
- West: Pass

**Recommended Fix (Phase 2):**
Enhance `feature_extractor.py` to add explicit "interference" tracking that records:
- `interference_present`: Boolean
- `interference_bid`: The actual overcall bid
- `interference_position`: Who made the overcall

This would allow negative doubles (and other competitive conventions) to work correctly.
