## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### Test Hand Corrections (Issues #1-4)
**Problem:** Four test hands had incorrect HCP calculations.

**Fixes:**
1. **Jacoby invitational test (Line 105)**
   - OLD: `♠Q65 ♥KJ985 ♦A73 ♣84` = 10 HCP
   - NEW: `♠Q65 ♥KJ985 ♦Q73 ♣84` = 8 HCP ✅

2. **Jacoby super-accept test (Line 129)**
   - Same fix as above

3. **Stayman invitational test (Line 157)**
   - OLD: `♠QJ85 ♥K6 ♦A73 ♣9842` = 10 HCP
   - NEW: `♠QJ85 ♥K6 ♦Q73 ♣J842` = 9 HCP ✅

4. **Stayman fit test (Line 181)**
   - Same fix as above

### Takeout Double Fix (Issue #5)
**Problem:** Test hand had 3 hearts, but takeout doubles require 0-2 cards in opponent's suit.

**Fix:**
- OLD: `♠AQ8 ♥K94 ♦K752 ♣865` (3 hearts ❌)
- NEW: `♠AQ8 ♥9 ♦KQ752 ♣J865` (1 heart ✅)

**Root Cause:** Test design error - takeout doubles require shortness in opponent's suit.

### Blackwood Response Fix (Issue #6)
**Problem:** Decision engine wasn't checking Blackwood for responder, only for opener.

**Fix:** Modified [decision_engine.py:62-66](backend/engine/ai/decision_engine.py#L62-L66)
```python
# Added Blackwood check for responder (partner opened)
if auction['opener_relationship'] == 'Partner':
    # Check for slam conventions first
    blackwood = BlackwoodConvention()
    if blackwood.evaluate(features['hand'], features):
        return 'blackwood'
```

**Root Cause:** Decision engine logic gap - Blackwood convention should apply to both opener and responder.

## ✅ Conclusion

**Phase 1 testing is complete with 100% pass rate!**

All critical convention fixes from Phase 1 are working correctly. The test failures were primarily due to test design issues (incorrect HCP values and invalid hand shapes), not code bugs. The one legitimate code issue (Blackwood for responder) has been fixed.

**Status:** Ready to proceed to Phase 2 moderate priority fixes.
