"""
Regression test for the 7NT disaster bug (2025-10-24).

Critical bug where West bid 7NT with only 9 HCP (27 combined).
Root cause: Blind bid adjustment escalated 2NT→7NT without sanity checks.

This test ensures the fix prevents:
1. Unreasonable slam bids with insufficient HCP
2. Runaway bid escalation (>2 levels)
3. Responder rebids using wrong module
