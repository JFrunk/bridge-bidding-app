"""
Regression tests for Blackwood overbidding bugs from October 2025.

These tests cover two critical bugs where the AI incorrectly used Blackwood
convention (4NT) when the partnership had insufficient combined strength for slam.

Bug 1 (hand_2025-10-27_13-35-31.json):
- East: 20 HCP, West: 11 points
- West incorrectly jumped to 3♣ with only 11 points and 3-card support
- East then bid 4NT Blackwood with only 31 combined HCP (need 33+)

Bug 2 (hand_2025-10-27_13-48-24.json):
- North: 19 HCP, South: 8 HCP (27 combined)
- North bid 4NT Blackwood after South showed 6-9 points
- Should have bid 3NT instead
- No 8-card trump fit (only 7 spades)

Root Cause:
- Blackwood module doesn't check combined partnership HCP before asking for aces
- No validation that slam is realistic before using Blackwood
- Missing check for adequate trump fit
