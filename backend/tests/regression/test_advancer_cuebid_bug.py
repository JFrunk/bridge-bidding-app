"""
Regression test for advancer cuebid bug.

BUG DESCRIPTION:
When advancing partner's overcall with a strong hand (12+ points), the advancer
would make a "cuebid" that actually bid the OPPONENT'S suit, and then continue
to raise that suit as if it were trump.

EXAMPLE BUGGY AUCTION:
South opens 1♦, West overcalls 1♠, North makes negative double, East "cuebids" 3♦
Then East continues with 4♦, 5♦, 6♦ - bidding the opponent's diamond suit!
East-West should be in 4♠ with their 8-card spade fit.

ROOT CAUSE:
- AdvancerBidsModule returned opponent's suit as the bid recommendation
- Module had no context tracking to remember original overcall suit
- Subsequent calls continued to "raise" the opponent's suit

FIX:
- Disabled cuebid logic (commented out with TODO)
- Added direct game bids for strong hands (12+ points with fit)
- Added context tracking to prevent re-bidding without extras
- Added _subsequent_advance() to handle competition intelligently
