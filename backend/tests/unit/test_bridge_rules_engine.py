"""
Comprehensive test suite for BridgeRulesEngine

Tests all scenarios for hand visibility and control according to bridge rules.
Covers all combinations of:
- User position (N, E, S, W)
- Declarer position (N, E, S, W)
- User role (declarer, dummy, defender)
- Game state (before/after opening lead)
