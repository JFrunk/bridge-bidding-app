# AI Review Feature Documentation

## Overview

The AI Review feature allows users to request expert analysis of any hand during bidding. When a user encounters questionable bidding or wants to understand the AI's decisions, they can export the complete hand data and get a formatted prompt to paste into Claude Code for detailed analysis.

## Implementation Summary

**Option Selected:** Hybrid approach (Option 3 variation)
- Available at all times during bidding
- Saves all requests for batch analysis
- User input field for specific concerns/questions
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for seamless workflow

## User Workflow

1. **During any point in bidding**, user clicks **"ðŸ¤– Request AI Review"** button
2. Modal opens with:
   - Auto-generated filename preview
   - Optional text field to describe concerns
   - Two action buttons: "Save & Generate Prompt" or "Cancel"
3. User (optionally) enters their concern, e.g.:
   - "Why did North bid 3NT here?"
   - "Is South's 2â™¥ bid correct?"
   - "Should East have overcalled?"
4. User clicks **"Save & Generate Prompt"**
5. System:
   - Saves complete hand data to `backend/review_requests/hand_TIMESTAMP.json`
   - Generates formatted prompt for Claude Code
   - Displays prompt in modal
6. User clicks **"ðŸ“‹ Copy to Clipboard"**
7. User pastes prompt into Claude Code for expert analysis

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

**File: [server.py](backend/server.py)**
- Added imports: `os`, `datetime`
- New endpoint: `/api/request-review` (POST)
  - Accepts: `auction_history` (array), `user_concern` (string)

  - Returns: `{success, filename, filepath}`

**Directory Created:**
- `backend/review_requests/` - Stores all review requests

### Frontend Changes

**File: [App.js](frontend/src/App.js)**

### Review Request JSON Format

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T21:34:37.155834",
  "all_hands": {
    "North": {
      "cards": [{"rank": "Q", "suit": "â™ "}, ...],
      "points": {
        "hcp": 10,
        "dist_points": 1,
        "total_points": 11,
        "suit_hcp": {"â™ ": 2, "â™¥": 1, "â™¦": 4, "â™£": 3},
        "suit_lengths": {"â™ ": 3, "â™¥": 2, "â™¦": 3, "â™£": 5}
      }
    },
    // East, South, West with same structure
  },
  "auction": [
    {"bid": "Pass", "explanation": "Less than 13 total points."},
    {"bid": "Pass", "explanation": "Less than 13 total points."}
  ],
  "vulnerability": "NS",
  "dealer": "North",
  "user_position": "South",
  "user_concern": "Is North's opening bid correct? What about East's response?"
}
```

## Generated Prompt Format

The system generates a prompt like this:

```
Please analyze the bidding in backend/review_requests/hand_2025-10-09_21-34-37.json
and identify any errors or questionable bids according to SAYC.

I'm particularly concerned about: [user's concern if provided]
```

## Testing

**Test Script:** `backend/test_review_feature.py`

The test script validates:
1. âœ… Hand dealing works
2. âœ… Auction simulation works
3. âœ… Review request endpoint works
4. âœ… JSON file is saved correctly
5. âœ… File contains all required data
6. âœ… Prompt generation works

**Test Results:**
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Modal doesn't appear
- **Check:** Is the frontend running on port 3000?
- **Check:** Browser console for JavaScript errors

### Issue: "Hand for [position] not available"
- **Cause:** No hand has been dealt yet
- **Fix:** Deal a hand first, then request review

### Issue: Clipboard copy doesn't work
- **Cause:** Browser security restrictions
- **Fix:** Manually select and copy the prompt text

### Issue: Review file not found
- **Check:** `backend/review_requests/` directory exists
- **Check:** Backend server has write permissions

## Design Decisions

### Why Option 3 (Hybrid)?
1. **No API costs** - Uses existing Claude Code access
2. **User control** - User decides when to invoke analysis
3. **Educational** - User sees and can modify the prompt
4. **Simple** - No API key management, no error handling for API calls
5. **Flexible** - User can add context to the prompt

### Why Save All Requests?
1. **Batch analysis** - Analyze multiple hands together
2. **Pattern detection** - Find systematic issues
3. **Historical record** - Track learning progress
4. **Debugging** - Reproduce issues from saved data

### Why Timestamped Filenames?
1. **No conflicts** - Each request gets unique file
2. **Sortable** - Easy to find recent requests
3. **Traceable** - Link requests to specific sessions
