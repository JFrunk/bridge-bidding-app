## [Unreleased] - refactor/shadcn-tailwind-migration branch

### Added
- **UI/UX Framework Migration**: Migrated to Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS with "Rule of Three" design system
- **Card Overlap**: Cards now overlap showing 35% visible (like real hand-holding)
  - Bidding phase: South's hand and "Show All Hands" display
  - Play phase: All player hands
  - Responsive: -45px desktop, -33px mobile, -25px extra small
- **Scoring Display**:
  - Shows in ContractHeader when hand completes (13 tricks)
  - Color-coded: green (positive), red (negative)
  - Displays result text (e.g., "Made 1", "Down 2")
- **Deal New Hand Button**: Primary action in score modal to start new hand immediately
- **Show All Hands Button**: Available in gameplay after hand completion for review
- **Learning Dashboard**: Progress tracking with analytics and mistake patterns
  - Access via "ðŸ“Š My Progress" button
  - Tracks bidding mistakes by category
  - Provides practice recommendations
  - Celebrates milestones
- **Contract Header Redesign**:
  - 13-block progress bar with visual goal marker
  - Trick counts below Won/Remaining/Lost labels
  - Goal indicator (â†“ 9) above progress bar
  - Bidding table with borders (N/E/S/W columns)

### Fixed
- **AI Play Bug**: AI no longer plays user-controlled cards after trick wins
  - Added check after trick clear to stop AI if next player is user-controlled
  - Prevents AI from playing South or dummy (when South is declarer)
- **Dummy Visibility**: North's dummy hand now appears after first card is played
  - Backend already had correct logic
  - Cards display ABOVE "North" label (standard bridge convention)
- **Trick Display Position**: Centered between all four players in compass layout
- **Standard Bridge Layout**: West on left, East on right, North top, South bottom

### Changed
- **Component Architecture**: Migrated to modern component structure
  - `components/bridge/`: BridgeCard, BiddingBox, ReviewModal, ConventionHelpModal
  - `components/play/`: ContractHeader, CurrentTrickDisplay, PlayableCard, ScoreModal, TurnIndicator
  - `components/learning/`: LearningDashboard, CelebrationNotification
  - `components/ui/`: Shadcn UI primitives (button, dialog, card, etc.)
- **Design System**: Implemented "Rule of Three"
  - Typography: 3 sizes (16px, 20px, 32px)
  - Colors: 3 core + suit colors
  - Spacing: 3 levels (1rem, 1.5rem, 3rem)
  - Senior-friendly: High contrast (WCAG AA), large touch targets (40px+)

### Technical Improvements
- **CSS Organization**: Separated concerns
  - `App.css`: Global styles and bidding phase
  - `PlayComponents.css`: Play phase specific styles
  - Component-specific CSS: TurnIndicator.css, LearningDashboard.css, etc.
- **State Management**: Proper React patterns
  - Clear separation of bidding vs play state
  - AI loop management with proper cleanup
  - Modal state management
