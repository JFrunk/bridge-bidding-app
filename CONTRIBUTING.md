## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- Node.js 18+
- Git

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd bridge_bidding_app

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Backend (from backend/ directory)
python server.py

# Frontend (from frontend/ directory)
npm start
```

## Development Workflow

We use the **development branch workflow**:

1. **Main branch** (`main` or `master`): Production-ready code
2. **Development branch** (`development`): Integration branch for features
3. **Feature branches**: Individual features or bug fixes

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Start from development branch
git checkout development
git pull origin development

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### Branch Naming Conventions

- `feature/feature-name` - New features
- `fix/bug-description` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `test/description` - Test additions/updates

## Documentation Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Documentation updates are MANDATORY for all code changes.

### Documentation is Part of Definition of Done

No PR will be merged without appropriate documentation updates. This is not optional.

### Required Documentation

For every code change, you must:

1. **Review the checklist**: Use [docs/DOCUMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md](docs/DOCUMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md)
2. **Follow the practices**: Read [.claude/DOCUMENTATION_PRACTICES.md](.claude/DOCUMENTATION_PRACTICES.md)
3. **Update all affected docs**: See the checklist for which files to update

### Documentation Standards

#### Always Update:
- Feature-specific docs in `docs/features/` if behavior changed
- README files if user-facing functionality changed
- API documentation for endpoint/interface changes
- Architecture docs if design patterns changed
- Bug fix docs in `docs/bug-fixes/` for resolved issues

#### File Organization:
```
docs/
├── architecture/          # System design and technical architecture
├── bug-fixes/            # Historical bug fix documentation
├── development-phases/   # Milestone and phase completion docs
├── features/             # Feature-specific implementation guides
├── guides/               # How-to guides and test documentation
├── project-overview/     # High-level summaries and index
└── debug-archive/        # Archived debugging information
```

### Documentation Quality Checks

Before submitting a PR, verify:
- [ ] All code examples are accurate and tested
- [ ] All internal links work
- [ ] No contradictions with actual code
- [ ] "Last Updated" dates are current
- [ ] New features are discoverable from index docs

## Code Standards

### Session State Architecture (CRITICAL - Oct 2025)

**⚠️ MANDATORY FOR ALL BACKEND CODE**

This application uses **session-based state management**. Global variables for user-specific state are strictly prohibited.

#### Backend Rules

🚫 **NEVER DO THIS:**
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Global state causes race conditions
current_deal = {}
current_vulnerability = "None"

@app.route('/api/endpoint')
def my_endpoint():
    global current_deal  # ❌ PROHIBITED!
    current_deal['South'] = Hand(...)
```

✅ **ALWAYS DO THIS:**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT - Use session state
from core.session_state import get_state

@app.route('/api/endpoint')
def my_endpoint():
    state = get_state()  # Get isolated session state
    state.deal['South'] = Hand(...)
    state.vulnerability = "NS"
    return jsonify({'success': True})
```

**Required pattern for every endpoint:**
1. Import: `from core.session_state import get_state`
2. First line: `state = get_state()`
3. Access via: `state.deal`, `state.vulnerability`, `state.play_state`, etc.
4. Never use `global` keyword for game state

**See:** [ADR-001 Session State Management](docs/architecture/decisions/001-session-state-management.md)

#### Frontend Rules

🚫 **NEVER DO THIS:**
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Missing session headers
fetch(`${API_URL}/api/deal-hands`)
```

✅ **ALWAYS DO THIS:**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Include session headers
import { getSessionHeaders } from './utils/sessionHelper';

fetch(`${API_URL}/api/deal-hands`, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    ...getSessionHeaders()  // ✅ REQUIRED!
  }
})
```

**Required pattern for all API calls:**
1. Import: `import { getSessionHeaders } from './utils/sessionHelper';`
2. Include in headers: `...getSessionHeaders()`
3. Never hardcode session IDs

**See:** [Frontend Session Migration](frontend/FRONTEND_SESSION_MIGRATION.md)

### Python (Backend)

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all functions/classes
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

```python
def calculate_hcp(hand: List[str]) -> int:
    """
    Calculate high card points for a bridge hand.

    Args:
        hand: List of card strings (e.g., ['AS', 'KH', '2D'])

    Returns:
        Total HCP as integer
    """
    # Implementation
```

### JavaScript/React (Frontend)

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep components small and focused

### Code Comments

- Comment **why**, not **what**
- Explain complex algorithms or business logic
- Document edge cases and assumptions
- Keep comments up to date with code

## Testing Requirements

### Backend Tests

All backend changes must include tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest backend/tests/test_opening_bids.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Test Coverage

- New features must have test coverage
- Bug fixes must include a test that would have caught the bug
- Aim for meaningful tests, not just coverage numbers

### Test Documentation

- Document test approach in feature docs
- Explain any complex test setups or mocks
- Update test guides if testing patterns change

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

```
type: Brief description (50 chars or less)

Longer description if needed. Explain the why, not the what.
Include any context, edge cases, or important decisions.

Closes #123 (if applicable)
```

### Commit Types

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes only
- `refactor:` Code refactoring (no functional changes)
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Build process, dependencies, etc.

### Examples

```
feat: Add support for negative doubles

Implements negative doubles for responder after opponent's overcall.
Includes point range requirements and suit length validation.

Closes #45

---

fix: Correct 2♣ forcing to game rebid logic

The opener was not properly forcing to game after 2♣ opening.
Now correctly requires rebid to continue forcing until game is reached.

Related to issue #67

---

docs: Update bidding system documentation for takeout doubles

Added comprehensive documentation for takeout double implementation
including point requirements, shape requirements, and responding logic.
```

### Documentation in Commits

- **Preferred**: Include documentation updates in the same commit as code
- **Alternative**: Separate commit with `docs:` prefix, referencing feature commit
- **Never**: Leave documentation for later
