## Analysis

### What's Working Perfectly ✅

**1. Opener's Rebid Module**
- **500 hands, 0 illegal bids**
- Previously had 18 illegal bids in 100 hands
- Fix is stable at scale

**2. Response Module**
- **500 hands, 0 illegal bids**
- Previously had 16 illegal bids in 100 hands
- Handles competitive auctions correctly

**3. Advancer Bids Module**
- **500 hands, 0 illegal bids**
- Previously had 7 illegal bids in 100 hands
- Partner of overcaller logic fixed

### Minor Issues Remaining ⚠️

**1. Blackwood Convention (8 issues)**
- **Frequency:** 5 hands out of 500 (1.0%)
- **Impact:** Slam bidding sequences
- **Severity:** LOW - Blackwood is used in <2% of hands
- **Note:** These are edge cases in competitive slam auctions

**2. Jacoby Transfer Convention (4 issues)**
- **Frequency:** 2 hands out of 500 (0.4%)
- **Impact:** Transfer bids after 1NT opening
- **Severity:** LOW - Affects <1% of hands
- **Note:** Transfer logic needs validation wrapper

**3. Michaels Cuebid (1 issue)**
- **Frequency:** 1 hand out of 500 (0.2%)
- **Impact:** Competitive two-suited overcall
- **Severity:** VERY LOW - Rare convention
- **Note:** Edge case in high-level competition
